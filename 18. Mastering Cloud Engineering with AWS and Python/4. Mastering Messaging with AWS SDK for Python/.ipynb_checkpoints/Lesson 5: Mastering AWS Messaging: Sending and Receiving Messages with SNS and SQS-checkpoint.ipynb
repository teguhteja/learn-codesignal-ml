    "# Lesson 5: Mastering AWS Messaging: Sending and Receiving Messages with SNS and SQS\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome back to Mastering Messaging with AWS SDK for Python. Today, we're exploring the integration of Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) and Simple Queue Service (SQS) to efficiently distribute messages. Employing the fan-out pattern allows a single publisher to communicate with multiple subscribers with ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a scenario involving three services: Service A, Service B, and Service C. Service A needs to send information to both Service B and Service C. Rather than Service A managing individual SQS queues for each, we can simplify this process using an SNS topic to fan out messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Publishing to an SNS Topic\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's quickly illustrate how Service A publishes a message to an SNS topic, including some advanced publishing options:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import boto3\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize the SNS resource\n",
    "sns_resource = boto3.resource('sns')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create an SNS topic\n",
    "topic = sns_resource.create_topic(Name='ServiceAUpdates')\n",
    "topic_arn = topic.arn\n",
    "\n",
    "# Publish a basic message\n",
    "publish_response = topic.publish(\n",
    "    Message='Updates for Services B and C',\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Publish a message with additional parameters\n",
    "publish_response_advanced = topic.publish(\n",
    "    Message='News update',\n",
    "    Subject='Weekly News',\n",
    "    MessageAttributes={\n",
    "        'Priority': {\n",
    "            'DataType': 'String',\n",
    "            'StringValue': 'High'\n",
    "        },\n",
    "        'Department': {\n",
    "            'DataType': 'Number',\n",
    "            'StringValue': 'IT'\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    },\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In these examples, we see a straightforward message broadcast to `ServiceAUpdates`, followed by an example with a Subject and MessageAttributes, adding context to messages sent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subscribing SQS to an SNS Topic\n",
    "\n",
    "To gear up Service B and Service C for message receipt, we'll direct them to listen to our SNS topic. This requires subscribing their SQS queues to the SNS topic:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import boto3\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize the SNS and SQS resources\n",
    "sns_resource = boto3.resource('sns')\n",
    "sqs_resource = boto3.resource('sqs')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Assume topic_arn is retrieved or known from previous steps\n",
    "topic = sns_resource.Topic(topic_arn)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create SQS queues for Service B and C\n",
    "serviceBQueue = sqs_resource.create_queue(QueueName='ServiceBQueue')\n",
    "queueB_arn = serviceBQueue.attributes['QueueArn']\n",
    "\n",
    "serviceCQueue = sqs_resource.create_queue(QueueName='ServiceCQueue')\n",
    "queueC_arn = serviceCQueue.attributes['QueueArn']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Subscribe the SQS queues to the SNS topic using the resource interface\n",
    "subscriptionB = topic.subscribe(\n",
    "    Protocol='sqs',\n",
    "    Endpoint=queueB_arn,\n",
    "    Attributes={\n",
    "        'RawMessageDelivery': 'true'\n",
    "    }\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "subscriptionC = topic.subscribe(\n",
    "    Protocol='sqs',\n",
    "    Endpoint=queueC_arn,\n",
    "    Attributes={\n",
    "        'RawMessageDelivery': 'true'\n",
    "    }\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This strategic approach ensures Service B and Service C are automatically updated with messages from Service A, efficiently demonstrating the fan-out pattern’s advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieving and processing messages from the queues remains straightforward, a practice reinforced from our earlier lessons:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Fetching messages from Service B's queue as an example\n",
    "messages = serviceBQueue.receive_messages(MaxNumberOfMessages=10)\n",
    "\n",
    "for message in messages:\n",
    "    print(message.body)\n",
    "    message.delete()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson concentrated on using SNS and SQS together for the fan-out messaging pattern, facilitating streamlined communication across multiple services. We've revisited key concepts like topic creation and have detailed the process of publishing messages to a topic and subscribing SQS queues to an SNS topic. Experiment with different SNS topics and SQS queues, exploring the myriad ways in which this powerful integration can be customized to fit various messaging needs."
