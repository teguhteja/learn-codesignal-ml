    "# Lesson 5: Mastering File Versioning and Management in Amazon S3 with Boto3\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the lesson on **mastering file versioning and management in Amazon S3 with Boto3**.  \n",
    "Versioning in Amazon S3 acts as a safeguard for your data, protecting against accidental overwrites or deletions by keeping multiple versions of an object, similar to maintaining various drafts of a document. Each update creates a new, retrievable version, ensuring no data is lost unintentionally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this lesson, we will explore how to enable, utilize, and effectively manage versioning in your S3 buckets using the Boto3 SDK.  \n",
    "This feature is crucial for maintaining data integrity and recoverability, especially in applications requiring rigorous backup solutions or historical data retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Enabling S3 Versioning with Boto3\n",
    "\n",
    "To activate versioning for an S3 bucket, you can use the **Boto3** library.  \n",
    "The Python code below shows you how to turn on versioning for a bucket named `my_bucket`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import boto3\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a session with your AWS credentials\n",
    "session = boto3.Session(\n",
    "    aws_access_key_id='your_access_key',\n",
    "    aws_secret_access_key='your_secret_key',\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Enable versioning on a bucket\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Suspending Versioning on a Bucket\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important aspect of managing your S3 bucket is the ability to **suspend versioning**.  \n",
    "It's crucial to understand that **once versioning is enabled on a bucket, it cannot be fully disabled**. However, you can suspend versioning, which stops S3 from assigning new version IDs to objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Suspending versioning on a bucket\n",
    "bucket_versioning.suspend()\n",
    "print('Bucket versioning has been suspended.')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** Suspending versioning **does not remove or delete existing versions**. It only stops new versions from being created.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Verifying the Status of Versioning\n",
    "\n",
    "After enabling versioning on your S3 bucket, it's good practice to verify its status:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "versioning_status = bucket_versioning.status\n",
    "print('Versioning Status:', versioning_status)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible status values:\n",
    "- **Enabled** → Versioning is fully active.\n",
    "- **Suspended** → Versioning is paused; new versions are not created.\n",
    "- **None** → Default state; versioning has never been enabled.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Uploading Objects to Version-Enabled Buckets\n",

    "Dive into the final task of managing space exploration data using Amazon S3! Your mission is to craft a script that activates bucket versioning and sequentially uploads a series of cosmic image files. You are provided with three unique images intended for upload in a specific order. Each image will replace the previous one under the same object key, \"course-logo.jpg\", showcasing how versioning in S3 maintains each version of an object, even as it's updated or replaced. After uploading all images, retrieve and print all versions of the \"course-logo.jpg\" to demonstrate the history of changes made to this object.\n",

To revert to the initial state, you can use the reset button located in the top right corner. However, keep in mind that resetting will erase any code changes.
