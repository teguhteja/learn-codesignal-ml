No coding is required for this task; simply review the script, understand its functionality, and then execute it.\n",

    "\n",
    "The provided Python script utilizes the Boto3 library to create a DynamoDB table named 'Users'. Here's a detailed breakdown of the script's functionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Import Libraries:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "import boto3\n",
    "from botocore.config import Config\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **boto3:** Amazon's SDK for Python, allowing interaction with AWS services.\n",
    "   - **botocore.config.Config:** Configuration settings for Boto3 (not used in this script).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initialize DynamoDB Resource:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb')\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Creates a DynamoDB resource object to interact with the DynamoDB service.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create DynamoDB Table:**\n",

    "\n",
    "   - **TableName:** Specifies the name of the table to create ('Users').\n",

    "   - **AttributeDefinitions:** Specifies the data type of the 'username' attribute as a String ('S').\n",
    "   - **ProvisionedThroughput:** Sets the read and write capacity units to 5 each, determining the table's throughput.\n",

    "4. **Wait for Table Creation:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "table.wait_until_exists()\n",

It initializes a DynamoDB resource, defines the table structure, waits for the table to be ready, and confirms its creation. The script is a clear example of setting up a basic DynamoDB table, suitable for applications requiring predictable read/write capacities."

    "Updated AttributeDefinitions:\n",

    "Implemented a Waiter:\n",

    "Created a waiter using dynamodb_client.get_waiter('table_exists') to ensure the table is fully created before proceeding.\n",
    "Configured the waiter to poll every 2 seconds and make a maximum of 10 attempts to avoid long waits and potential timeouts.\n",

    "Listed All DynamoDB Tables:\n",

    "Used dynamodb_client.list_tables() to retrieve and print the names of all DynamoDB tables, confirming that the 'Products' table has been successfully created.\n",

    "In your final task, you will synthesize what you have learned so far and write a script that creates two DynamoDB tables — Users and Customers. For the Users table, you should use a provisioned capacity mode with a read and write capacity of 5. For the Customers table, apply the on-demand capacity mode. Each table should have only one attribute serving as a primary key: username in Users, and customer_id in Customers. After successfully creating the tables, implement a command to display all of your existing DynamoDB tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, you will use wait_until_exists() for the Users table to automatically wait for the table to become active. For the Customers table, configure a custom waiter object to poll every 2 seconds and make a maximum of 10 attempts to check the status of the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important Note: Running scripts can modify the resources in our AWS simulator. To revert to the initial state, you can use the reset button located in the top right corner. However, keep in mind that resetting will erase any code changes. To preserve your code during a reset, consider copying it to the clipboard.\n",
