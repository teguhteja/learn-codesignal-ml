    "# Lesson 5: Manipulating Data in DynamoDB: Update and Delete Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the sixth lesson in our course, *Introduction to DynamoDB with AWS SDK for Python*. Up to this point, we've explored how to set up your environment with DynamoDB and Boto3, how to create and configure tables, and how to insert and retrieve data from these tables. Today, we're delving deeper into updating and deleting items from DynamoDB tables using AWS's Boto3 library in Python. We'll also review how to delete multiple items at once. The ability to modify data is crucial when managing databases, especially when handling large quantities of data in the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Updating Items in DynamoDB\n",
    "\n",
    "In Boto3, the `update_item` method allows for modifications to items in a DynamoDB table. This method requires the primary key of the item to be updated and an `UpdateExpression` that defines the changes to be appliedâ€”whether setting new values, removing attributes, or modifying lists or set attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of updating a post in the *UserPosts* table where 'John' is the primary key's username and '1' is the `post_id`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "table.update_item(\n",
    "    Key={'username': 'John', 'post_id': 1},\n",
    "    UpdateExpression='SET content = :val1',\n",
    "    ExpressionAttributeValues={':val1': 'Updated World!'}\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This operation updates the 'content' of John's post. Note that the full primary key must be specified for updates. Additionally, `update_item` operations consume write capacity units, and careful consideration is required to manage these costs. Aliases and reserved words must be handled carefully in expressions, and it's also possible to specify the consistency of the read after an update if required.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deleting Items from DynamoDB\n",
    "\n",
    "To remove an item, Boto3 uses the `delete_item` method. This requires the primary key of the item you wish to delete and can optionally include a `ConditionExpression` to specify conditions that must be met for the deletion to occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how you would delete a post by John with `post_id` 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "table.delete_item(Key={'username': 'John', 'post_id': 2})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This deletion operation also requires the full primary key and consumes write capacity units, similar to update operations. If conditions are specified and not met, the deletion will not proceed, helping prevent unintended data loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deleting Multiple Items At Once\n",
    "\n",
    "The `batch_writer` allows for batch operations, including deletions, providing an efficient way to handle multiple deletions at once:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with table.batch_writer() as batch:\n",
    "    batch.delete_item(Key={'username': 'John', 'post_id': 1})\n",
    "    batch.delete_item(Key={'username': 'Anna', 'post_id': 1})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This method will help reduce the number of API calls, but will still consume the same number of write capacity units.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary and Upcoming Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations on completing this lesson! You've learned how to update and delete items in DynamoDB tables effectively. You've also discovered how to manage multiple deletions simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prepare for upcoming hands-on practice exercises to reinforce these concepts and enhance your skills in DynamoDB operations. Keep up the excellent work and see you in the next lesson for more advanced DynamoDB techniques!"

    "## Running Full DynamoDB Operations Sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "Great job making it this far! This task will reaffirm your understanding of creating a DynamoDB table, inserting items, and performing operations to update and delete items. You will execute a pre-existing Python script that carries out a series of actions to manage a table named UserPosts and its items. The script includes a process for table creation, populating the table with some initial entries, updating items, and finally, deleting items from the table. Understanding each action being executed is extremely important. Go through the script, run it, and observe the results.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Explanation of Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Specifying the AWS Region:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   To avoid the `NoRegionError`, it's essential to specify the AWS region when initializing the DynamoDB resource. Replace `'us-east-1'` with your desired region if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb', region_name='us-east-1')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Handling Existing Tables:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   The script now checks if the `UserPosts` table already exists. If it does, it connects to the existing table; otherwise, it creates a new one.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   if table_name in table_names:\n",
    "       table = dynamodb.Table(table_name)\n",
    "       print(f\"Table '{table_name}' already exists.\")\n",
    "   else:\n",
    "       table = dynamodb.create_table(\n",
    "           # table creation parameters\n",
    "       )\n",
    "       print(\"Table 'UserPosts' creation initiated.\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Single Item Deletion:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   To delete John's second post (`post_id` 2), the `delete_item` method is used with the appropriate key. A `try-except` block handles potential errors gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print(\"Deleting John's second post...\")\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       table.delete_item(Key={'username': 'John', 'post_id': 2})\n",
    "       print(\"John's second post deleted successfully.\")\n",
    "   except ClientError as e:\n",
    "       print(f\"Failed to delete John's second post: {e.response['Error']['Message']}\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Batch Deletion of Multiple Items:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   To delete both John's first post (`post_id` 1) and Anna's first post (`post_id` 1), the `batch_writer` context manager is utilized. This approach efficiently handles multiple delete operations in a single batch, reducing the number of API calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print(\"Performing batch delete for John's first post and Anna's first post...\")\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       with table.batch_writer() as batch:\n",
    "           batch.delete_item(Key={'username': 'John', 'post_id': 1})\n",
    "           batch.delete_item(Key={'username': 'Anna', 'post_id': 1})\n",
    "       print(\"Batch delete performed successfully.\")\n",
    "   except ClientError as e:\n",
    "       print(f\"Failed to perform batch delete: {e.response['Error']['Message']}\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Improved Print Statements:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Clear and descriptive print statements provide feedback on each operation's success or failure, enhancing the script's readability and debuggability.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print(\"John's second post deleted successfully.\")\n",
    "   print(\"Batch delete performed successfully.\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Exception Handling:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   The `ClientError` exception from `botocore.exceptions` is caught to handle any issues that arise during deletion operations, such as attempting to delete a non-existent item.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from botocore.exceptions import ClientError\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This ensures that the script doesn't crash unexpectedly and provides meaningful error messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "These modifications ensure that your script can effectively delete individual items as well as multiple items in bulk from your DynamoDB table. Additionally, specifying the AWS region prevents common initialization errors, allowing your operations to execute smoothly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Important Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **AWS Credentials:**\n",
    "  Ensure that your AWS credentials are correctly configured. You can set them up using the AWS CLI or by specifying them in environment variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Error Handling:**\n",
    "  The `try-except` blocks help in catching and handling errors gracefully. It's good practice to handle potential exceptions to make your scripts more robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Batch Operations Limits:**\n",
    "  DynamoDB batch operations have limits on the number of items that can be processed in a single batch. Be mindful of these limits to prevent errors during batch deletions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Provisioned Throughput:**\n",
    "  Deletion operations consume write capacity units. Monitor your table's provisioned throughput to manage costs effectively, especially when performing bulk deletions.\n",
    "\n",
    "By implementing these deletion techniques, you'll enhance your ability to manage DynamoDB tables efficiently, ensuring that your applications can maintain clean and up-to-date data"

    "- **AWS Credentials**:\n",
    "  Ensure that your AWS credentials are correctly configured. You can set them up using the AWS CLI, environment variables, or AWS configuration files.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Error Handling**:\n",
    "  The `try-except` blocks handle potential exceptions gracefully, preventing the script from crashing and providing meaningful error messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Provisioned Throughput**:\n",
    "  Deletion operations consume write capacity units. Monitor your table's provisioned throughput to manage costs effectively, especially when performing bulk deletions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Batch Operations Limits**:\n",
    "  DynamoDB batch operations have limits on the number of items that can be processed in a single batch. Be mindful of these limits to prevent errors during batch deletions.\n",
    "\n",
    "By implementing these update and delete techniques, you enhance your ability to manage DynamoDB tables efficiently, ensuring that your applications maintain clean and up-to-date data."
