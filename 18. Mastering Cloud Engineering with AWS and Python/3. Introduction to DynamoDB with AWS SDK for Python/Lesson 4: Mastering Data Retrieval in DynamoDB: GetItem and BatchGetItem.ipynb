    "# Lesson 4: Mastering Data Retrieval in DynamoDB: GetItem and BatchGetItem\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction and Context Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome back! Having previously set up and configured tables in DynamoDB using Python's Boto3 library, today we focus on retrieving data from these tables. Retrieving data is crucial for any database system as it allows us to access and utilize stored data effectively. In this lesson, we concentrate on two pivotal operations—GetItem and BatchGetItem. Both are essential for efficient data retrieval, whether you're pulling a single item or multiple items based on their keys. By the end of this session, you'll be well-equipped to handle data retrieval tasks in DynamoDB proficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reading Data with \"GetItem\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieving data from a DynamoDB table is straightforward when you have the full primary key of the item you're interested in. Let's say we need details for *The Big New Movie* released in 2016 from our Movies table, where year and title make up the primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a simple read, you can retrieve the item like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Simple read\n",
    "result = table.get_item(Key={'year': 2016, 'title': 'The Big New Movie'})\n",
    "if 'Item' in result:\n",
    "    print(\"Movie found:\", result['Item'])\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Movie not found.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you only need certain attributes, you can specify them using the `ProjectionExpression` parameter:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Attributes projection\n",
    "result = table.get_item(\n",
    "    Key={'year': 2016, 'title': 'The Big New Movie'},\n",
    "    ProjectionExpression='title, genre',\n",
    ")\n",
    "if 'Item' in result:\n",
    "    print(\"Projected attributes of the movie:\", result['Item'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For a strongly consistent read, add the `ConsistentRead` parameter:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Strongly consistent read\n",
    "result = table.get_item(\n",
    "    Key={'year': 2016, 'title': 'The Big New Movie'},\n",
    "    ConsistentRead=True\n",
    ")\n",
    "if 'Item' in result:\n",
    "    print(\"Consistently read movie details:\", result['Item'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Retrieving Multiple Items with BatchGetItem\n",
    "\n",
    "For fetching several items known by their primary keys, DynamoDB provides the **BatchGetItem** API. This operation is different from GetItem, as it retrieves more than one item at a time from a table. When using BatchGetItem, you'll need to specify the full primary key for each item—this means both the partition key and sort key if the table has a composite primary key. Here’s an example of how to retrieve multiple items using their full primary keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "response = dynamodb.batch_get_item(\n",
    "    RequestItems={\n",
    "        'Movies': {\n",
    "            'Keys': [\n",
    "                {'year': 2016, 'title': 'The Big New Movie'},  # Full primary key (partition key and sort key)\n",
    "                {'year': 2017, 'title': 'The Bigger, Newer Movie'}  # Full primary key\n",
    "            ],\n",
    "            'ConsistentRead': True\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above snippet, each dictionary in the Keys array contains a complete primary key that identifies a unique item in the Movies table. Specifying the full primary key in your BatchGetItem request ensures precise and efficient retrieval of the items you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "While BatchGetItem is a powerful tool for retrieving multiple items at once, it comes with several limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Maximum Items:** You can fetch up to 25 items in a single batch request.\n",
    "- **Maximum Data Retrieval:** The total amount of data retrieved in a single batch operation cannot exceed 16 MB.\n",
    "- **Unprocessed Keys:** If any part of your batch request cannot be processed due to capacity unit limitations or internal server errors, those items are returned in the `UnprocessedKeys` response. You need to handle these cases by retrying the failed requests.\n",
    "- **Capacity Unit Consumption:** Each item read in the batch consumes read capacity units (RCUs). When specifying `ConsistentRead` as `True`, the operation consumes twice the standard RCU for each item.\n",
    "\n",
    "These limitations require careful planning when implementing batch operations to ensure efficient usage of DynamoDB's resources and handling potential partial failures in batch requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Handling Reserved Words in DynamoDB Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with DynamoDB, certain attribute names may coincide with reserved words used by the service. Using these reserved words directly in expressions for operations like GetItem can cause errors. To circumvent this issue, you can use aliases defined in an `ExpressionAttributeNames` map along with a `ProjectionExpression` to specify the attributes you want to retrieve. This approach allows you to safely use reserved words in your DynamoDB operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how you can handle reserved words in DynamoDB expressions by combining `ExpressionAttributeNames` with a `ProjectionExpression`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "result = table.get_item(\n",
    "    Key={'year': 2021, 'title': 'Example Movie'},\n",
    "    ProjectionExpression='#yr, title',\n",
    "    ExpressionAttributeNames={'#yr': 'year'}\n",
    ")\n",
    "if 'Item' in result:\n",
    "    print(\"Movie found with reserved word attribute:\", result['Item'])\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Movie not found.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Some common reserved words that often require aliasing in DynamoDB include attributes like *Year*, *Date*, *Total*, *Order*, and *Status*. By aliasing these words, you can use them freely in your queries without encountering syntax errors. This practice ensures your database queries are robust and error-free.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary and Looking Ahead\n",
    "\n",
    "Great job on completing today's lesson on DynamoDB data retrieval techniques! We've delved into the GetItem and BatchGetItem methods, showing you how to fetch specific items and multiple items efficiently. These techniques are vital for effective data management in DynamoDB, accommodating various data access patterns within your applications. Now, take this knowledge into practice with the exercises provided, applying these methods to diverse scenarios. In our upcoming sessions, we'll explore further into DynamoDB's capabilities, focusing next on its powerful update and delete functionalities to enhance your data management skills.

    "## Running Scripts and Manipulating DynamoDB Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, you are required to run an existing Python script that will create a table named Movies in DynamoDB and populate it with several movie records. Furthermore, the script will retrieve and print specific items from the Movies table. Your primary task is to evaluate the output generated by running the script and understand the workflow of creating a table, adding items to it, and retrieving these items using various methods. No additional modifications or coding are required from you; all you need to do is run the script and comprehend how it operates.\n",

    "### Script Output Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Running the provided Python script performs the following sequence of operations on DynamoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Creating the `Movies` Table:**  \n",
    "   The script initiates the creation of a DynamoDB table named `Movies` with `year` as the partition key and `title` as the sort key. It specifies the necessary attribute definitions and provisioned throughput settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Waiting for Table Creation:**  \n",
    "   The script waits until the `Movies` table is successfully created or until 20 seconds have elapsed. This ensures that subsequent operations can be performed on the newly created table.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Inserting Movie Records:**  \n",
    "   Six movie records are added to the `Movies` table using the `put_item` method. Each record includes a `year` and a `title`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Retrieving a Single Item with `GetItem`:**  \n",
    "   The script retrieves the movie titled *\"The Big New Movie\"* released in 2016 using the `get_item` method and prints the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Retrieving Multiple Items with `BatchGetItem`:**  \n",
    "   It fetches two movies—*“The Big New Movie”* (2016) and *“The Bigger, Newer Movie”* (2017)—using the `batch_get_item` method and prints the retrieved items.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expected Output\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon executing the script, the following output is generated:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "{'year': 2016, 'title': 'The Big New Movie'}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[\n",
    "    {'year': 2016, 'title': 'The Big New Movie'},\n",
    "    {'year': 2017, 'title': 'The Bigger, Newer Movie'}\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Breakdown of the Output\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Single Item Retrieval (`GetItem`):**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   result = table.get_item(Key={'year': 2016, 'title': 'The Big New Movie'})\n",

    "   This output indicates that the script successfully retrieved both specified movies in a single batch operation. Using `BatchGetItem` enhances efficiency by allowing multiple items to be fetched simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding the Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "The script demonstrates a typical workflow for interacting with DynamoDB using Python's Boto3 library:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Table Creation:**  \n",
    "   Establishes the structure of the table by defining primary keys and setting throughput capacities.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Insertion:**  \n",
    "   Populates the table with records, each uniquely identified by the combination of `year` and `title`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Retrieval:**  \n",
    "   Utilizes both `GetItem` for single-item access and `BatchGetItem` for retrieving multiple items, showcasing flexible data access patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following this workflow, you can effectively manage and interact with data in DynamoDB, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval tailored to your application's needs."

    "\n",
    "2. **Increased Read Capacity Consumption:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Impact:** Strongly consistent reads consume more read capacity units (RCUs) compared to eventually consistent reads. Specifically, each strongly consistent read requires twice the RCUs of an eventually consistent read.\n",
    "   - **Consideration:** Plan your provisioned throughput accordingly to accommodate the increased usage, especially in high-traffic applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Potential Latency:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Impact:** May experience slightly higher latency as the system ensures data consistency across all replicas before returning the result.\n",
    "   - **Consideration:** While generally minimal, it's important to assess whether the trade-off between consistency and latency aligns with your application's requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Cost Implications:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Impact:** Due to higher RCU consumption, using strong consistency can lead to increased costs, especially for applications with heavy read operations.\n",
    "   - **Consideration:** Evaluate the necessity of strong consistency for your use case to balance performance and cost effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "By enforcing strong consistency in your read operations, you ensure that your application always accesses the most recent data from DynamoDB. While this enhances data accuracy and reliability, it's essential to be mindful of the associated costs and resource consumption. Assess your application's specific needs to determine the optimal consistency model, leveraging strong consistency where it's most beneficial."

    "    - **Parameters:**\n",
    "        - `RequestItems`: Specifies the table name and the list of primary keys (`year` and `title`) identifying the items to retrieve.\n",
    "        - `ConsistentRead=True`: Ensures that the read operations return the most up-to-date data.\n",

    "#### Understanding the Enhancements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **BatchGetItem Operation:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "    - **Efficiency:** Fetching multiple items in a single `BatchGetItem` request reduces the number of network calls, resulting in faster data retrieval and lower latency compared to individual `GetItem` requests.\n",
    "    - **Strong Consistency:** By setting `ConsistentRead=True`, the operation ensures that the retrieved items reflect all prior write operations, providing accurate and reliable data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Error Handling Considerations:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "    - **Unprocessed Keys:** While not handled in this script, it's important to note that `batch_get_item` may return unprocessed keys if the request exceeds DynamoDB's capacity limits. In a production environment, you should implement logic to retry fetching these unprocessed keys.\n",
    "    - **Provisioned Throughput:** Ensure that your DynamoDB table's provisioned throughput is adequately configured to handle the read and write operations, especially when using strong consistency modes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **AWS Region Specification:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "    - **Importance:** Specifying the `region_name` is crucial to direct the resource to the correct AWS region, avoiding connectivity issues and ensuring compliance with data residency requirements.\n",
    "    - **Customization:** Adjust the region according to where your DynamoDB table is hosted or your organization's best practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "By incorporating the `BatchGetItem` operation into your Python script, you enhance the efficiency of data retrieval from the DynamoDB `Movies` table. This approach allows for simultaneous fetching of multiple items, ensuring that your application can access necessary data swiftly and reliably. Additionally, specifying the AWS region prevents common configuration errors, ensuring seamless interaction with your DynamoDB resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deploying these best practices in your DynamoDB interactions will contribute to building scalable, efficient, and robust applications tailored to your data management needs."

    "## Mastering DynamoDB Operations in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Great job so far! In this task, you will continue to build upon your foundational knowledge of DynamoDB by writing Python scripts that not only demonstrate your ability to interact with DynamoDB tables but also to manipulate and retrieve data efficiently. You will begin with a template that already includes scripts for creating a DynamoDB table named Movies and populating it with several records. Your focus will be on expanding this script to include data retrieval operations using GetItem and BatchGetItem. Specifically, you will demonstrate different retrieval strategies including simple reads, reads with projection, and ensuring strongly consistent reads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important Note: Keep in mind that running scripts can modify the resources in our AWS simulator. If you need to revert your AWS environment to its initial state, use the reset button located in the top right corner of the simulator interface. However, resetting the environment will remove any code changes you've made during your session. To avoid losing your work, remember to save your code externally before hitting the reset button.\n",

    "    - **Use Case:** Ideal for scenarios where you need to access specific records without additional constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **GetItem with ProjectionExpression**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Functionality:** Enables selective retrieval of specific attributes within an item.\n",
    "    - **Advantages:**\n",
    "        - **Performance:** Reduces the amount of data transferred, leading to faster response times.\n",
    "        - **Cost-Efficiency:** Minimizes read capacity unit (RCU) consumption by fetching only necessary attributes.\n",
    "    - **Considerations:** Ensure that the projected attributes exist; otherwise, they will be omitted from the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Strongly Consistent GetItem**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Functionality:** Guarantees that the data read reflects all prior writes, ensuring data accuracy.\n",
    "    - **Advantages:**\n",
    "        - **Data Reliability:** Essential for applications where data integrity is critical, such as financial systems.\n",
    "    - **Trade-offs:**\n",
    "        - **Higher RCU Consumption:** Strongly consistent reads consume twice the RCUs of eventually consistent reads.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Attribute Definitions:** Ensure that all attributes you intend to project or retrieve exist in your DynamoDB items to avoid missing data in your results.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Provisioned Throughput:** Monitor and adjust your table's read and write capacity units based on your application's usage patterns to prevent throttling and ensure optimal performance.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling, especially for batch operations, to gracefully manage scenarios where some items cannot be retrieved in a single request.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **AWS Region Specification:** Always specify the appropriate AWS region when creating DynamoDB resources to avoid connectivity issues and ensure compliance with data residency requirements.\n",
