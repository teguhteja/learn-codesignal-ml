    "# Lesson 4: Managing Logs with AWS SDK for Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to a new adventure! As we continue our journey with Python and AWS using Boto3, we are diving into logging in Boto3 in this lesson. We'll explore Python's logging library, its interaction with Boto3, and how to leverage logs to better understand your API requests and responses. Let's get started!  \n",

    "## Importance of Logging  \n",
    "\n",
    "Our applications often present puzzles that require careful analysis and investigation. Logs are like the bread crumbs that help us navigate these puzzles. They provide insights into the actions of our application, assisting us in understanding AWS service interaction, identifying potential issues, and tracking the overall health of our operations. This kind of visibility is essential for efficient debugging and management of AWS interactions.  \n",

    "### Specific Service Logging  \n",
    "To focus on one service, use the name of that service's client. For instance, for S3 operations, use `'botocore.client.S3'`.  \n",

    "## Recap: Common Logging Levels in Python  \n",
    "\n",
    "Python's logging module features several logging levels, representing different severities of the events to be logged. These are:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **DEBUG** : Captures detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.  \n",
    "- **INFO** : Confirms that things are working as expected.  \n",
    "- **WARNING** : Indicates that something unexpected happened, or there may be a problem in the future (e.g., \"disk space low\").  \n",
    "- **ERROR** : More serious problems that have prevented the program from performing a function.  \n",
    "- **CRITICAL** : Very serious errors, which may prevent the program from running.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By default, Python's logging library is set to `WARNING`. This means the system will ignore all logging messages that have lower severity than `WARNING`. This includes `DEBUG` and `INFO` messages.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want all messages to be logged, you can change the base level to `DEBUG` or `INFO` via:  \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)\n",
    "```\n",
    "or  \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Itâ€™s a common practice to adjust this setting during development and then change it back to `WARNING` or higher once the application is deployed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Logging Best Practices and Considerations  \n",
    "\n",
    "Logging requires careful handling. Avoid logging sensitive information like access tokens, passwords, and personally identifiable information (PII), and ensure log access is properly restricted within your organization. When properly configured, logging can offer invaluable insights for development and troubleshooting while securely managing information.  \n",

    "- `boto3.set_stream_logger('botocore.client.S3', logging.DEBUG)`: This fine-tunes logging to capture all detailed interactions specifically for the S3 client.\n",
    "- The try-except block catches any exceptions during the S3 operation (like `list_buckets()`) and logs the error with `logging.error()`.\n",
