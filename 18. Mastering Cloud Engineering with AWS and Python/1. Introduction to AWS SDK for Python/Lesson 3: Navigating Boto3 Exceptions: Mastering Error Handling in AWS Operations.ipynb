    "# Lesson 3: Navigating Boto3 Exceptions: Mastering Error Handling in AWS Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome back! As we progress further in our journey with Python's Boto3 library and AWS, today we turn our attention to **resilience** ‚Äî how to handle exceptions effectively when interacting with AWS services.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Two primary types of exceptions occur when using Boto3 with AWS:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **ClientError**: Arises from AWS services due to invalid operations.  \n",
    "- **BotoCoreError**: Occurs due to client-side issues within Boto3 or its dependencies.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Getting a handle on these exceptions and understanding how to mitigate them is a vital component of building **reliable applications**. Let's dive into it!  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üõ† AWS-Side Exceptions: `ClientError`  \n",
    "\n",
    "When AWS services respond with an error, Boto3 raises a **ClientError**. These exceptions represent issues occurring on the AWS side due to incorrect operations, such as:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Accessing an **S3 bucket that doesn't exist**  \n",
    "- Performing an **unauthorized IAM action**  \n",
    "\n",
    "ClientError instances contain both the **error message** and the **AWS response**. The response can be extracted using `error.response`, which contains an error dictionary with details on what went wrong:  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Handling `ClientError`  \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import boto3\n",
    "from botocore.exceptions import ClientError\n",
    "\n",
    "s3client = boto3.client('s3')\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    s3client.get_object(Bucket='wrong-bucket', Key='my-file')\n",
    "except ClientError as error:\n",
    "    error_info = error.response['Error']\n",
    "    print(f\"Error code: {error_info['Code']}\")  # Output: \"Error code: NoSuchBucket\"\n",
    "    print(f\"Error message: {error_info['Message']}\")  # \"Error message: The specified bucket does not exist.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach helps you **debug efficiently** by retrieving details from `error.response['Error']['Code']` and `error.response['Error']['Message']`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîß Boto3 Client-Side Exceptions: `BotoCoreError`  \n",
    "\n",
    "While **ClientError** represents AWS-side issues, **BotoCoreError** occurs due to problems with Boto3 itself or its dependencies. These errors include:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Invalid AWS service name**  \n",
    "- **Configuration issues**  \n",
    "- **Missing credentials**  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Handling `BotoCoreError`  \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import boto3\n",
    "from botocore.exceptions import BotoCoreError\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    client = boto3.client('non-existent-service')\n",
    "except BotoCoreError as error:\n",
    "    print(error)  # Output: Unknown service: 'non-existent-service'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This helps diagnose connectivity, service misconfiguration, or missing dependency issues within Boto3.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üéØ Service-Specific Exceptions  \n",
    "\n",
    "Each AWS service defines its **own set of exceptions**, available through the `exceptions` attribute of client and resource objects. This allows for fine-grained error handling.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Handling an S3-Specific Exception  \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Attempt some S3 operation\n",
    "except s3client.exceptions.NoSuchBucket:\n",
    "    print(\"The specified bucket does not exist.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach enhances error-handling precision, allowing targeted exception management for different AWS services.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üèÜ Best Practices for Error Handling  \n",
    "\n",
    "To build **resilient AWS applications**, follow these best practices:  \n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ **Broad to Specific**: Start with catching `ClientError`, then refine with service-specific exceptions.  \n",
    "‚úÖ **Understand Your Errors**: Check error codes and messages. Refer to the [Boto3 documentation](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html) for detailed exception lists.  \n",
    "‚úÖ **Graceful Error Handling**: Implement retries, fallbacks, or user-friendly error messages instead of crashing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìå Conclusion  \n",
    "\n",
    "Thorough exception handling is **crucial** when working with AWS services in Boto3. By leveraging the detailed exceptions provided and following best practices, you can ensure that your application:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Behaves **predictably**  \n",
    "- Provides **useful feedback** during errors  \n",
    "- **Recovers smoothly** from failures  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now it's time to **experiment** with different error scenarios and refine your handling strategies. Keep exploring, and let‚Äôs continue our AWS journey! üöÄ  \n",

    "In this task, your primary objective is to observe a Python script in action that attempts to list all objects of a non-existent S3 bucket, which inevitably triggers an exception. This exercise will expose you to how AWS service exceptions during operations are handled effectively in real-world scenarios. Your role is to run the script and understand the error handling process - no code modifications are needed for this task.\n",

    "Important Note: Running scripts can modify the resources in our AWS simulator. To revert to the initial state, you can use the reset button located in the top right corner. However, bear in mind that resetting will erase any code changes. To preserve your code during a reset, consider copying it to your clipboard.\n",

    "This script is a great way to observe **exception handling in Boto3** when trying to list objects from a non-existent S3 bucket. Here's a **breakdown** of what happens:  \n",
    "\n",
    "### üîç **What the Script Does**:\n",
    "1. **Creates an S3 client** using Boto3.\n",
    "2. **Attempts to list objects** from a bucket named `'non-existent-bucket'`, which doesn't exist.\n",
    "3. **Handles AWS-related errors** (`ClientError`):\n",
    "   - **`NoSuchBucket`**: If the bucket doesn‚Äôt exist, prints `\"The bucket does not exist.\"`\n",
    "   - **`AccessDenied`**: If access is restricted, prints `\"You do not have permissions to access the bucket.\"`\n",
    "   - **Other errors**: Prints `\"Unexpected error\"` along with the error message.\n",
    "4. **Handles Boto3-specific issues** (`BotoCoreError`), such as misconfigurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üõ† **Expected Behavior**\n",
    "Since the bucket **does not exist**, the script will likely raise a `ClientError` with `\"NoSuchBucket\"`, and you'll see:  \n",
    "```\n",
    "The bucket does not exist.\n",
    "```\n",
    "If there‚Äôs a permission issue instead, it will print:\n",
    "```\n",
    "You do not have permissions to access the bucket.\n",
    "```\n",
    "If there's a different AWS-side error, it will print:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Unexpected error: <error message>\n",
    "```\n",
    "If Boto3 itself runs into a **client-side issue**, such as missing credentials, it will print:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Boto3 error: <error details>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ **Key Takeaways**\n",
    "- This **simulates a real-world AWS error scenario**.\n",
