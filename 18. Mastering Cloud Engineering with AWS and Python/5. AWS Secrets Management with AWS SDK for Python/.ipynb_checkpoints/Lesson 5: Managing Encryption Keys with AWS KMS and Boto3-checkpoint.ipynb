    "# Lesson 5: Managing Encryption Keys with AWS KMS and Boto3\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to another exciting lesson of our course - **Mastering Cloud Engineering with AWS and Python**. Today, we delve into managing encryption keys with the **AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In previous lessons, we covered securing AWS resources and managing secrets using **AWS Secrets Manager** and **AWS SSM Parameter Store**. Now, we will extend that knowledge by learning how to **create, control, and use AWS KMS keys** and how to **encrypt and decrypt data** using AWS KMS.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding AWS KMS\n",
    "The **AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)** is a managed service that helps you create and manage cryptographic keys for data protection. It supports various key types, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "### AWS KMS Keys:\n",
    "AWS KMS keys are the core resources in AWS KMS, used to encrypt up to 4 KB of data directly and manage other cryptographic operations. There are two types of AWS KMS keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **AWS Managed KMS Keys**:  \n",
    "  - Automatically created and managed by AWS for specific integrated services.  \n",
    "  - Used for default service encryption and lifecycle operations like key rotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Customer Managed KMS Keys**:  \n",
    "  - Created and managed by you.  \n",
    "  - Offers more control, including policy management, key rotation, and auditing.  \n",
    "  - Unlike AWS-managed KMS keys, these incur usage charges.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Keys:\n",
    "- Generated by AWS KMS and used to encrypt your data outside of KMS.\n",
    "- Data keys are encrypted under an AWS KMS key and can be decrypted to plaintext only when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Asymmetric Keys and Key Pairs:\n",
    "For operations requiring separate keys for encryption and decryption or digital signing, AWS KMS supports **asymmetric KMS keys**, generating a **public and private key pair**.\n",
    "\n",
    "AWS KMS is designed for security, meeting compliance requirements with its **hardware security modules (HSMs)** that are **FIPS 140-2 validated**, making it suitable for managing sensitive data across AWS services.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**: The term **customer master key (CMK)** is an old term that means the same as **AWS KMS key**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## AWS KMS Keys vs Data Keys: A Document Storage Example\n",
    "To grasp the distinction between **AWS KMS keys** and **data keys**, consider a secure document storage service.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Use of AWS KMS Keys**\n",
    "- **Central Management and Policy Control**:  \n",
    "  AWS KMS keys enable centralized control over encryption policies.\n",
    "- **Audit and Compliance**:  \n",
    "  AWS CloudTrail logs help track key usage for security audits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Use of Data Keys**\n",
    "- **Efficient Document Encryption**:  \n",
    "  AWS KMS keys are not suited for encrypting large data directly. Instead, **data keys** encrypt the actual documents.\n",
    "- **Document Encryption Process**:\n",
    "  - AWS KMS key generates a **data key**.\n",
    "  - The plaintext version encrypts the document.\n",
    "  - The encrypted data key is stored alongside the document.\n",
    "- **Secure Access and Sharing**:\n",
    "  - Encrypted data keys are decrypted using AWS KMS keys before decrypting the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "This **hybrid encryption approach** ensures **high-level management with AWS KMS keys** while maintaining **efficiency using data keys**.\n",
    "\n",
