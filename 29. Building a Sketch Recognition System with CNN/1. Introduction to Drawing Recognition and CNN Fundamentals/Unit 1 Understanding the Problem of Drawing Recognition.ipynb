                                    "Drawing recognition is a fascinating and challenging problem in the field of computer vision. It involves teaching machines to understand and interpret hand-drawn sketches, which can vary significantly in style, size, and quality. This task is not only about recognizing shapes but also about understanding the context and meaning behind the drawings. This is a complex problem because human drawings can be highly variable. For example, the same digit can be drawn in many different ways, and the quality of the drawing can vary from person to person. Additionally, drawings may contain noise or artifacts that can make recognition difficult. To tackle this problem, we will use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are a type of deep learning model specifically designed for image processing tasks. CNNs are capable of automatically learning and extracting features from images, making them well-suited for recognizing patterns in hand-drawn sketches. CNNs work by applying a series of convolutional filters to the input images, allowing them to learn hierarchical representations of the data. This means that the model can learn to recognize simple shapes in the early layers and more complex patterns in the deeper layers. By training on a large dataset of labeled images, CNNs can achieve high accuracy in recognizing and classifying hand-drawn sketches.\n",

One-hot encoding transforms these integer labels into binary vectors, where each vector has the same length as the number of classes (in this case, 10). In a one-hot encoded vector, all elements are 0 except for the index corresponding to the class label, which is set to 1. For example, the label `3` becomes `[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
