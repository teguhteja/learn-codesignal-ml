Entity Recognition or Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a task in information extraction that involves identifying and classifying named entities (like persons, places, organizations) present in a text into pre-defined categories. It is essentially the process by which an algorithm can read a string of text and say, \"Ah, this part of the text refers to a place, and this part refers to a person!\"\n",

As mentioned above, spaCy has a built-in Named Entity Recognition system that can recognize a wide variety of named or numerical entities. This comes as a part of spaCy's statistical models, and not all the language models support it. However, the model we are using, `en_core_web_sm`, supports Named Entity Recognition.\n",

The `Doc` is then processed in several different steps – this is also known as the processing pipeline. The pipeline used by the `en_core_web_sm` model consists of a tagger, a parser, and an entity recognizer.
