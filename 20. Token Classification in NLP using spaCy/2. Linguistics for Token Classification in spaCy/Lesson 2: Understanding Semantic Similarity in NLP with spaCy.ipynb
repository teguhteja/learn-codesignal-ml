This can be extremely useful in numerous applications, such as simplifying search engines by understanding that a search for \"canine\" could warrant results related to \"dog\", or even in more complex tasks such as automatic text summarization. Semantic similarity is usually represented in numerical form, where values close to 1 indicate high similarity, and values close to 0 indicate low similarity.\n",
