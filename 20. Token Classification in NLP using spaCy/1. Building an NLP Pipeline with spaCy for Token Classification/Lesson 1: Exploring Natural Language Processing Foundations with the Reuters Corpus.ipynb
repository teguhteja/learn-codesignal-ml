    "# Lesson 1: Exploring Natural Language Processing Foundations with the Reuters Corpus\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lesson Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello and welcome! In today's lesson, we dive into the world of Natural Language Processing (NLP). NLP is a branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the interaction between computers and humans using natural language. Today, you'll get introduced to basic NLP concepts, using a popular Python library for natural language processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intro to Natural Language Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural Language Processing, or NLP, is a field of study that focuses on the interactions between human language and computers. It sits at the intersection of computer science, artificial intelligence, and computational linguistics. NLP involves making computers understand, interpret, and manipulate human language. It's an essential tool for transforming unstructured data into actionable information. For example, it can help us understand the sentiments of customers about a product by analyzing online reviews and social media posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning and data science play a big role in NLP. They provide the methods to \"teach\" machines how to understand our language. As data scientists, understanding NLP techniques can help us create better models for text analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Investigating the Reuters Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand natural language processing, we first need to have a dataset to work with. For this course, we'll be using the Reuters Corpus from the Natural Language Toolkit (nltk), which is a set of corpora and lexical resources for natural language processing and machine learning in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by importing the required library and downloading the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Importing the necessary libraries\n",
    "import nltk\n",
    "\n",
    "# Download the Reuters dataset\n",
    "nltk.download('reuters')\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, our Reuters dataset is downloaded and ready to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exploring Documents in the Reuters Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore our dataset. The first thing to do is to load the dataset and see how many documents there are:\n",
    "\n",
    "from nltk.corpus import reuters\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load the dataset\n",
    "documents = reuters.fileids()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the number of documents\n",
    "print(f\"There are {len(documents)} documents in the Reuters dataset\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the above code will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "There are 10788 documents in the Reuters dataset\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each file ID in this dataset represents a document. We can pick any file ID and see the raw text in it:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load the text of a single document\n",
    "document_text = reuters.raw(documents[0])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the first 500 characters of the document text\n",
    "print(\"\\nThe first 500 characters of the first document:\\n\")\n",
    "print(document_text[:500])\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the above code will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "The first 500 characters of the first document:\n",
    "\n",
    "ASIAN EXPORTERS FEAR DAMAGE FROM U.S.-JAPAN RIFT\n",
    "  Mounting trade friction between the\n",
    "  U.S. And Japan has raised fears among many of Asia's exporting\n",
    "  nations that the row could inflict far-reaching economic\n",
    "  damage, businessmen and officials said.\n",
    "      They told Reuter correspondents in Asian capitals a U.S.\n",
    "  Move against Japan might boost protectionist sentiment in the\n",
    "  U.S. And lead to curbs on American imports of their products.\n",
    "      But some exporters said that while the conflict wo\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There you have it—the raw text data we will be dealing with. This may look like quite a lot right now. But, as we go through this course, you'll learn how we can break down and handle text data efficiently using NLP techniques like tokenization, POS tagging, and lemmatization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analyzing Document Categories\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Reuters dataset, each document belongs to one or more categories. Understanding these categories will give us a holistic view of our documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll just check the categories of a single document for now:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the categories of the first document\n",
    "print(\"\\nThe categories of the first document are:\")\n",
    "print(reuters.categories(documents[0]))\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the above code will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "The categories of the first document are:\n",
    "['trade']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These categories provide us with a top-level view of what each document is about.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lesson Summary and Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "There we go! We have taken our first steps into the world of Natural Language Processing by exploring the Reuters Corpus from the Natural Language Toolkit (nltk).\n",
    "\n",
    "As we move forward, we will be working on setting up a proper NLP pipeline and learning key NLP techniques such as tokenization, POS tagging, and lemmatization. All these skills will be extremely useful for your data science and machine learning journey. So, let's keep moving forward and continue exploring these in the upcoming lessons."

    "Fantastic work, Stellar Navigator!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, using the Reuters dataset, alter the starter code to print the total number of unique categories in the dataset, instead of printing all categories and their counts. Remember, the len function can count the elements in a set!\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Importing the necessary NLTK corpus\n",
    "from nltk.corpus import reuters\n",
    "\n",
    "# Obtain all (duplicated) categories in the dataset\n",
    "all_categories = reuters.categories()\n",

    "\n",
    "# Iterate through the unique categories\n",
    "for category in unique_categories:\n",

    "# Print the total number of unique categories\n",
    "print(f\"The Reuters dataset contains {len(unique_categories)} unique categories.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This simplified version will output something like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "The Reuters dataset contains 90 unique categories.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The key changes made:\n",
    "* Removed the unnecessary dictionary creation and counting loop since we only need the total count\n",
    "* Used `set()` directly on `reuters.categories()` to get unique categories\n",
    "* Added a more descriptive print statement\n",
    "* Removed the detailed category counts which weren't needed for this task\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us a cleaner, more focused solution that directly answers the question of how many unique categories exist in the dataset. The set data structure automatically handles the deduplication of categories for us, making the code both efficient and straightforward"
