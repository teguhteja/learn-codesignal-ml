DeepSeek is an advanced AI platform that offers state-of-the-art language models capable of understanding and generating human-like text. Its unique features include high accuracy in language comprehension, the ability to generate contextually relevant responses, and a robust API that supports seamless integration into various applications. These capabilities make DeepSeek an excellent choice for building AI tutors, as it can provide personalized and insightful interactions with users.\n",
