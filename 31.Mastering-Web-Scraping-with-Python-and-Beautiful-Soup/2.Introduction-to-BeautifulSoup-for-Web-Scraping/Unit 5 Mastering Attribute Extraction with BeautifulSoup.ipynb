This skill is critical when dealing with web scraping as attributes often hold important data or links to more data. We'll work through a simple example that demonstrates the process of parsing HTML data, locating a specific tag, and extracting its attributes. By the end of this lesson, you'll be equipped with sufficient tools to effectively extract and manipulate attributes from HTML in your web scraping projects. Let's get started\\!\n",
