                "1.  **Transactional Integrity:** The entire process—creating the `Changeset` and all associated `ChangesetFile` records—is wrapped in a single database session. If any part of the process fails (e.g., in the loop), the `except SQLAlchemyError` block executes `db.rollback()`, ensuring no incomplete data is left in the database.\n",
                "2.  **`db.flush()`:** This is a critical step. By calling `db.flush()` immediately after adding the `new_changeset`, SQLAlchemy executes the statement to the database *without committing* the transaction. This assigns a concrete `id` to the `new_changeset` object, which is then immediately available to be used as the `changeset_id` foreign key for the subsequent `ChangesetFile` records.\n",
                "3.  **Background Tasks:** Using `BackgroundTasks` ensures that the user receives an immediate response confirming submission, even if the review process (which involves the potentially slow AI call) takes several seconds to complete. This is key for building a good user experience\\!\n",

                "  * **Review and Update:** Inside the `try` block, the changeset is retrieved using the new session, the `review_engine.process_review()` is called, and the status is updated to `\"reviewed\"`.\n",
                "  * **Transaction Management:**\n",
                "      * `db_bg.commit()` saves the status change.\n",
                "      * The `except` blocks call `db_bg.rollback()` to ensure the database state is clean if any error (database or otherwise) occurs during processing.\n",
                "  * **Session Closure:** The `finally` block with `db_bg.close()` guarantees the session is always released, preventing resource leaks, even if an exception occurs.\n",

                "      * The API returns immediately after calling this line.\n",
                "      * FastAPI executes `process_changeset_review` with the newly created `changeset.id` *after* the HTTP response is sent to the client. This allows the API to be highly responsive while the long-running review process happens in the background.\n",
                "  * **Initial Status:** I've explicitly set `status=\"pending\"` in the main endpoint to indicate the review has started but is not yet complete."
