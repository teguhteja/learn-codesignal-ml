                "      * A `try...except DiffParsingError` block is used to catch expected parsing issues (e.g., malformed diffs).\n",
                "      * A generic `except Exception` catches any other unforeseen errors during parsing.\n",
                "      * If parsing fails, the method immediately returns a helpful error message, preventing subsequent code from crashing due to a missing `diff_object`.\n",
                "\n",
                "2.  **Defensive Context Gathering:**\n",
                "\n",
                "      * `getattr(changeset_file, 'file_path', 'unknown_file')` is used to safely get the file path, providing a **default value** if the attribute is missing.\n",
                "      * **Context functions** (`get_file_context`, `get_recent_changes`, `find_related_files`) are wrapped in individual `try...except` blocks. If one context function fails, it only logs a warning and sets that variable to `None`, allowing the rest of the review process to continue with partial context.\n",
                "\n",

                "\n",
                "      * The code uses `dict.get('key', 'default_value')` within the list comprehension for `recent_changes`. This ensures that if a change dictionary is missing a key (like `'hash'` or `'message'`), the code won't crash and will instead use a safe fallback value (`'N/A'` or `'No message'`).\n",

                "      * The call to `self.llm_client.analyze_changeset` is wrapped in a final `try...except` block.\n",
                "      * If the LLM service fails (simulated by the `error` keyword in the diff), it catches the exception, logs the error, and returns a **graceful fallback message**, ensuring the user knows the AI service is the problem, not the engine itself.\n",
                "\n",
                "5.  **Full Changeset Review:**\n",
                "\n",
                "      * The `review_full_changeset` method adds a `try...except` block *around the loop call* to `review_changeset_file`. This ensures that even a catastrophic, unexpected crash during the processing of a single file will only cause that file's review to fail, but the engine will continue processing all other files in the changeset."
