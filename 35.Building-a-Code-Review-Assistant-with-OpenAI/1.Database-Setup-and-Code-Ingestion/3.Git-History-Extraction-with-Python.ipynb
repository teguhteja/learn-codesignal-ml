                "1.  **Method Signature:** `def extract_commits(self, repo_path: str, max_commits: int = 50, file_extensions: Optional[List[str]] = None):` was updated to accept the new parameter.\n",
                "2.  **Filter Check:** `filter_enabled = file_extensions is not None` determines if the filtering logic needs to be run.\n",
                "3.  **Normalization:** Extensions are converted to **lowercase** (`normalized_extensions = [ext.lower() for ext in file_extensions]`) to ensure case-insensitive matching against file paths.\n",
                "4.  **Commit-Specific List:** `current_commit_changes` temporarily stores all file changes for the current commit.\n",
                "5.  **Matching Flag:** `commit_matches_filter` is initialized to `True` if no filter is active, or `False` if a filter is active.\n",
                "6.  **Extension Check:**\n",
                "      * `_, ext = os.path.splitext(file_path)` correctly splits the file path into the root and the extension.\n",
                "      * If filtering is enabled and `ext.lower()` is found in `normalized_extensions`, we set `commit_matches_filter = True` and **break out of the file change loop** for that commit, as the requirement is to include the commit if **ANY** file matches.\n",
                "7.  **Final Inclusion:** The `GitCommit` object is only created and both `self.commits` and `self.file_changes` are only updated **if** `commit_matches_filter` is `True`.\n",
                "8.  **Main Function Reset:** In `main()`, a **new** instance of `GitHistoryExtractor` (`extractor_filtered = GitHistoryExtractor()`) is created before the filtered call. This is crucial because the extractor stores results in `self.commits` and `self.file_changes`, and we need to **reset** those lists for a new, filtered extraction."
