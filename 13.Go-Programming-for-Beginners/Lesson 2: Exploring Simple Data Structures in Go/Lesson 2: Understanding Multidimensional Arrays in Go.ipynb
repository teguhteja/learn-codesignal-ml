    "# Topic Overview and Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello and welcome! Today, we're diving into **multidimensional arrays in Go**, which are arrays of arrays. Their organizational structure is similar to a checkerboard, where each square can hold a value. By the end of our journey, you'll know how to create, initialize, and work with these arrays. Let's get started!\n",

    "## Understanding Multidimensional Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "A **two-dimensional (2D) array** in Go is much like a grid, consisting of multiple rows (the array) and columns (the arrays within the array).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "Imagine a box of chocolates with several rows and columns:\n",
    "- The box is the **array**.\n",
    "- Each cell is an **array element**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Go, a similar 2D array is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "var chocolates [3][3]string\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `chocolates` is a 2D array that can hold 9 strings arranged in a 3x3 structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating and Initializing Multidimensional Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "To fill our box of chocolates, we initialize the array:\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "var chocolates = [3][3]string{\n",
    "  {\"dark\", \"white\", \"milk\"},\n",
    "  {\"hazelnut\", \"almond\", \"peanut\"},\n",
    "  {\"caramel\", \"mint\", \"coffee\"},\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rows**: Represent the first index.\n",
    "- **Columns**: Represent the second index.\n",
    "- Go arrays have a **fixed size**, defined at creation, and cannot be resized.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accessing Values in Multidimensional Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "To access elements in a 2D array, you use two indices:\n",
    "1. The first index for the row.\n",
    "2. The second index for the column.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```go\n",
    "selectedChoc := chocolates[0][2]\n",
    "fmt.Println(\"Selected chocolate: \", selectedChoc)  // Output: milk\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `chocolates[0][2]`: Accesses the element in the first row and third column.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lesson Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "üéâ **Marvelous!** You now have a solid understanding of multidimensional arrays in Go. Here's what we covered:\n",
    "- **Definition**: Arrays of arrays, structured like a grid.\n",
    "- **Initialization**: Creating and populating 2D arrays with values.\n",
    "- **Accessing Elements**: Using two indices to retrieve specific values.\n",

    "    fmt.Println(\"Bottom right chocolate flavor: \", assortedChocolates[1][1])\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "1. **Bottom Right Corner**:\n",
    "   - The array has two rows (`0` and `1`) and two columns (`0` and `1`).\n",
    "   - The bottom right element is at index `[1][1]` (row 1, column 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Updated Print Statement**:\n",
    "   - Changed the text to describe the bottom right chocolate flavor: `fmt.Println(\"Bottom right chocolate flavor: \", assortedChocolates[1][1])`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output:\n",
    "When you run this program, it will print:\n",
    "```\n",
