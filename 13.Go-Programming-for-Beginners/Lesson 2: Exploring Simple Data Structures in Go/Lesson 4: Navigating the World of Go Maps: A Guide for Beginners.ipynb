    "# Overview and Introduction to Maps in Go\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome aboard for our journey with Go's maps! Maps, a built-in data type, make it easy to organize and find data within collections â€” a crucial feature for effective programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Go, maps link one value (the key) to another value. For instance, you can associate a student (the key) with their grade (the value) in a roster. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What We'll Cover\n",
    "1. **Crafting and Initializing Go Maps**  \n",
    "2. **Interacting with Map Elements**  \n",
    "3. **Understanding Maps as Reference Types**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dive in!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Declaring and Initializing Maps in Go\n",
    "\n",
    "Declaring a map in Go is straightforward. You can use the `make` function or a composite literal. Here's how:\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "// Using the make function\n",
    "var grades1 = make(map[string]int)\n",
    "\n",
    "// Using composite literal syntax\n",
    "var grades2 = map[string]int{}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Pre-populated map using composite literal syntax\n",
    "var grades3 = map[string]int{\"John\": 85, \"Jane\": 90}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above examples:\n",
    "- **Keys** are strings (e.g., `\"John\"`), and \n",
    "- **Values** are integers (e.g., `85`).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Working with Maps\n",
    "\n",
    "Go maps allow efficient manipulation of their elements. Here's how to add, update, retrieve, and delete entries:\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "var grades = make(map[string]int)\n",
    "grades[\"John\"] = 85   // Add John's grade\n",
    "grades[\"Jane\"] = 90   // Add Jane's grade\n",
    "\n",
    "johnGrade := grades[\"John\"]     // Retrieve John's grade\n",
    "grades[\"John\"] = 95             // Update John's grade\n",
    "\n",
    "delete(grades, \"John\")          // Delete John's entry\n",
    "\n",
    "johnGrade, johnExists := grades[\"John\"] // Check if John's grade exists\n",
    "if johnExists {\n",
    "    fmt.Println(johnGrade)  // Won't execute, as John was deleted\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points:\n",
    "- Use the **key** (e.g., `\"John\"`) to perform operations.\n",
    "- Itâ€™s simpler and more intuitive than using indices in arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Maps and Reference Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Maps in Go are **reference types**. Assigning a map to a new variable creates a reference, not a copy:\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "var originalData = map[string]int{\"apple\": 1, \"banana\": 2}\n",
    "var copiedData = originalData\n",
    "copiedData[\"apple\"] = 100\n",
    "\n",
    "fmt.Println(originalData) // Reflects updated value: 100\n",
    "fmt.Println(copiedData)  // Also reflects updated value: 100\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaway:\n",
    "Changes made to `copiedData` affect `originalData` since both point to the same underlying data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",

    "- How to **manipulate map elements** (add, update, delete, retrieve).\n",
