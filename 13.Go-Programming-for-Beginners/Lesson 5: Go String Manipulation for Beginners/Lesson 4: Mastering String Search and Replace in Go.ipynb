    "# Lesson 4: Mastering String Search and Replace in Go\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview and Actualizing the Topic  \n",
    "\n",
    "Hello, learners! In today's session, we will explore searching and replacing strings in Go. Imagine this scenario: you're operating a chat service and need to filter and replace certain inappropriate words. This lesson will show you how to accomplish this task using Go's standard `strings` package.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### String Searching: The `strings.Index` and `strings.LastIndex` Functions  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with string searching. Go offers the `strings.Index` and `strings.LastIndex` functions.  \n",
    "- **`strings.Index`**: Returns the index of the first occurrence of a substring.  \n",
    "- **`strings.LastIndex`**: Returns the index of the last occurrence of a substring.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1: Using `strings.Index`  \n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "package main\n",
    "\n",
    "import (\n",
    "    \"fmt\"\n",
    "    \"strings\"\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "func main() {\n",
    "    str := \"Hello, CodeSignal learners!\"\n",
    "    fmt.Println(strings.Index(str, \"CodeSignal\")) // Output: 7, as str[7:16] = \"CodeSignal\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the string \"CodeSignal\" begins at index **7** in our string.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2: Using `strings.LastIndex`  \n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "package main\n",
    "\n",
    "import (\n",
    "    \"fmt\"\n",
    "    \"strings\"\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "func main() {\n",
    "    str := \"CodeSignal is fun. I love CodeSignal!\"\n",
    "    fmt.Println(strings.LastIndex(str, \"CodeSignal\")) // Output: 26\n",
    "}\n",
    "```  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, \"CodeSignal\" starts at index **26** in the last instance within our string. Efficient, isn't it?  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Checking Substring Existence: The `strings.Contains` Function  \n",
    "\n",
    "The `strings.Contains` function checks whether a string contains a particular sequence of characters, regardless of their position.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:  \n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "package main\n",
    "\n",
    "import (\n",
    "    \"fmt\"\n",
    "    \"strings\"\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "func main() {\n",
    "    str := \"Welcome to CodeSignal!\"\n",
    "    fmt.Println(strings.Contains(str, \"CodeSignal\")) // Output: true\n",
    "}\n",
    "```  \n",
    "\n",
    "This proves that \"CodeSignal\" is present in our string. These practical functions are highly useful for real-world situations!  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### String Replacement: The `strings.ReplaceAll` Function  \n",
    "\n",
    "Replacing specific elements within strings is easy with `strings.ReplaceAll`. This function replaces **all** instances of the provided substring with another string.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:  \n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "package main\n",
    "\n",
    "import (\n",
    "    \"fmt\"\n",
    "    \"strings\"\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "func main() {\n",
    "    str := \"Apples are sweet. I love apples! Apples are healthy as well.\"\n",
    "    fmt.Println(strings.ReplaceAll(str, \"Apples\", \"Oranges\")) \n",
    "    // Output: \"Oranges are sweet. I love apples! Oranges are healthy as well.\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that \"apples\" (lowercase) remains unchanged because Go treats \"Apples\" (uppercase) and \"apples\" as distinct strings.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### String Replacement: The `strings.Replace` Function  \n",
    "\n",
    "To replace **only a specific number of occurrences** of a target word, use `strings.Replace`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:  \n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "package main\n",
    "\n",
    "import (\n",
    "    \"fmt\"\n",
    "    \"strings\"\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "func main() {\n",
    "    str := \"Apples are sweet. I love apples because apples are healthy.\"\n",
    "    fmt.Println(strings.Replace(str, \"apples\", \"oranges\", 1)) \n",
    "    // Output: \"Apples are sweet. I love oranges because apples are healthy.\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, only the **first occurrence** of \"apples\" (lowercase) is replaced with \"oranges\". The `1` as the fourth argument specifies the number of replacements to perform.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lesson Summary and Practice  \n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸŽ‰ Fantastic job! Now, you can utilize Go's string search and modification functions effectively:  \n",
    "1. **`strings.Index`** and **`strings.LastIndex`**: Locate specific elements in a string.  \n",
    "2. **`strings.Contains`**: Confirm the presence of a substring.  \n",
    "3. **`strings.ReplaceAll`**: Replace **all** occurrences of a substring.  \n",
    "4. **`strings.Replace`**: Replace a **specific number** of occurrences.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Hands-on exercises are up next! Practice consistently to master these concepts. Happy coding! ðŸš€  "

    "## Promoting Go in Online Chats\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're helping to moderate an online chat and need to replace all occurrences of the word \"Coding\" with \"Go\" to promote the Go programming language. Note that we care only about \"Coding\", starting with a capital C, don't replace \"coding\". Here's a snippet of code that demonstrates this change. Run the code to see how it cleans up the message!\n",
    "\n",
    "package main\n",
    "\n",
    "import (\n",
    "    \"fmt\"\n",
    "    \"strings\"\n",

    "    fmt.Println(filteredMessage) // Output: \"I love coding. Go is fun!\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided Go code snippet demonstrates replacing the exact word **\"Coding\"** (with an uppercase \"C\") in a string with **\"Go\"**, while leaving **\"coding\"** (lowercase) untouched. Running the code results in the following output:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code\n",
    "```go\n",
    "package main\n",
    "\n",
    "import (\n",
    "    \"fmt\"\n",
    "    \"strings\"\n",
    ")\n",

    "    filteredMessage := strings.ReplaceAll(chatMessage, \"Coding\", \"Go\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "    fmt.Println(filteredMessage) // Output: \"I love coding. Go is fun!\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "1. The input string is `chatMessage = \"I love coding. Coding is fun!\"`.\n",
    "2. The `strings.ReplaceAll` function is case-sensitive and replaces all occurrences of **\"Coding\"** in the string with **\"Go\"**.\n",
    "3. The word **\"coding\"** remains unaffected because the replacement targets only the exact match **\"Coding\"** (case-sensitive).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "```\n",
    "I love coding. Go is fun!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This behavior is crucial in scenarios where case-sensitive modifications are needed in text moderation or transformation tasks."

    "    fmt.Println(moderatedMessage)\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "1. Initially, the `strings.ReplaceAll` function replaces the phrase **\"bad words\"** with `\"****\"`.\n",
    "2. Another call to `strings.ReplaceAll` substitutes the phrase **\"refrain from\"** with **\"avoid\"**.\n",
    "3. The final output combines both replacements.\n",

    "### Output\n",
    "```\n",
    "Go is great, but please avoid using ****.\n",
    "```\n",
