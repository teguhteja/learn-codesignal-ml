    "# Lesson Introduction: String Operations in Go\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome! Today, we're delving into the crucial operations associated with **Strings** in Go. Strings are fundamental in most programming languages as they are used for displaying and manipulating textual data. In this lesson, you'll learn about the basic string operations in Go, such as concatenation, comparison, and the use of common functions from the `strings` package.\n",

    "## Revising String Concatenation\n",
    "\n",
    "Concatenation â€” the process of joining items together â€” is a principal string operation. In Go, string concatenation is achieved using the `+` operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "package main\n",
    "\n",
    "import \"fmt\"\n",
    "\n",
    "func main() {\n",
    "    var hello = \"Hello, \"\n",
    "    var world = \"World!\"\n",
    "    var greeting = hello + world\n",
    "\n",
    "    fmt.Println(greeting) // \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `\"Hello, \"` and `\"World!\"` were combined to form the string `\"Hello, World!\"`.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparing Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "### Equality (`==`) Operator\n",
    "\n",
    "The `==` operator checks whether two strings are equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "package main\n",
    "\n",
    "import \"fmt\"\n",
    "\n",
    "func main() {\n",
    "    var firstWord = \"Hello\"\n",
    "    var secondWord = \"Hello\"\n",
    "    var areEqual = firstWord == secondWord\n",
    "\n",
    "    fmt.Println(areEqual) // Outputs: true\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since `firstWord` and `secondWord` are equal, the result is `true`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Less Than (`<`) Operator\n",
    "\n",
    "The `<` operator determines if one string is alphabetically before another.\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "package main\n",
    "\n",
    "import \"fmt\"\n",
    "\n",
    "func main() {\n",
    "    var firstWord = \"Apple\"\n",

    "    var isLess = firstWord < secondWord\n",
    "\n",
    "    fmt.Println(firstWord, \"is less than\", secondWord, \"?\", isLess) // Outputs: Apple is less than Banana? true\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alphabetically, `\"Apple\"` comes before `\"Banana\"` because `A` comes before `B`. In case of a tie, Go compares the subsequent letters. For example, `\"Apple\"` is less than `\"Application\"` because `e` is less than `i`.\n",
