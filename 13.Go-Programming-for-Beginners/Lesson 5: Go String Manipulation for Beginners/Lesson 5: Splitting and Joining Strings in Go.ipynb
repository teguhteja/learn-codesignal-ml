    "# Lesson 5: Splitting and Joining Strings in Go\n",
    "\n",
    "# Overview and Actualization\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello, Adventurer! Today, we will learn about splitting and joining strings — two vital operations for processing textual data in Go. Are you ready? Let's start this journey!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding String Splitting in Go\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will use the following imports:\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "package main\n",
    "\n",
    "import (\n",
    "    \"fmt\"\n",
    "    \"strings\"\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In Go, the `strings.Split` function cuts a string into several pieces based on a delimiter, which is a character that separates words. It returns a slice containing these divided parts. Look at this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "sentence := \"I love programming.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "// Let's split it into individual words\n",
    "words := strings.Split(sentence, \" \") // Now words = [\"I\", \"love\", \"programming.\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "// Loop through each word and print\n",
    "for _, word := range words {\n",
    "    fmt.Println(word)\n",
    "}\n",
    "// Prints:\n",
    "// I\n",
    "// love\n",
    "// programming.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we have a sentence cut into separate words using the `strings.Split()` function, with a space as the delimiter. The results are stored in the slice `words`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mastering String Joining\n",
    "\n",
    "The `strings.Join()` function merges a slice of strings back into a single string using a given delimiter. You can think of it as the inverse of the `strings.Split()` operation. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "// Our original words\n",
    "words := []string{\"programming.\", \"I\", \"love\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Let's join the words into a new sentence\n",
    "sentence := strings.Join(words, \" \")\n",
    "\n",
    "fmt.Println(sentence)  // Output: \"programming. I love\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example given above, we took a slice of words and combined them into a single string, using a space as the delimiter.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Combining Splitting and Joining\n",
    "\n",
    "Both `strings.Split()` and `strings.Join()` can be used together to manipulate texts such as rearranging sentences. Let's take `\"I love programming\"` and rearrange it to `\"programming love I\"`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "sentence := \"I love programming.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "// Split the sentence into words\n",
    "words := strings.Split(sentence, \" \")\n",
    "\n",
    "// Swap the first and third words\n",
    "tempWord := words[0]\n",
    "words[0] = words[2]\n",
    "words[2] = tempWord\n",
    "\n",
    "// Join the words back into a sentence\n",
    "newSentence := strings.Join(words, \" \")\n",
    "\n",
    "fmt.Println(newSentence) // Output: \"programming. love I\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we first split the sentence into words. Then, we swapped the positions of the first and last words before finally joining them back into a new sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, `strings.Join` is flexible — it allows you to specify all parts to join one by one:\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "fmt.Println(strings.Join([]string{\"See\", \"how\", \"you\", \"can\", \"join\", \"any\", \"number\", \"of\", \"words!\"}, \" \"))\n",
    "// Output: See how you can join any number of words!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It proves to be quite handy at times!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary and Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "Great job, Explorer! You've learned how to split and join strings in Go using `strings.Split()` and `strings.Join()`. Now, you will try your hand at some exercises to reinforce your newly acquired skills. Are you ready to explore further? Let's proceed!\n",

    "## String Transformation of a Shakespearean Quote in Go\n",
    "\n",
    "Space Voyager, your next challenge awaits! Shakespeare's works are filled with dramatic and poetic expressions. Your task is to transform a famous quote into a Shakespearean play verse format. You'll need to split a quote into individual words, then join them in a unique way to enhance its dramatic effect. Think about how each word can stand out as if it were part of a play's script.\n",
    "\n",
    "package main\n",
    "\n",
    "import (\n",
    "    \"fmt\"\n",

    "    \n",
    "    fmt.Println(verse)\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "To transform Shakespeare's famous quote into a play-style verse where each word appears on a new line, you can use `strings.Join` with a newline character (`\\n`) as the delimiter after splitting the quote into words. Here's how you can complete the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Full Solution:\n",
    "```go\n",
    "package main\n",
    "\n",
    "import (\n",
    "    \"fmt\"\n",
    "    \"strings\"\n",
    ")\n",

    "func main() {\n",
    "    quote := \"To be, or not to be: that is the question.\"\n",
    "    // Split the famous Shakespeare quote into words\n",

    "    \n",
    "    fmt.Println(verse)\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "1. **Splitting the Quote**:\n",
    "   - The `strings.Split(quote, \" \")` function divides the quote into individual words based on spaces.\n",
    "   - The result is a slice of words: `[\"To\", \"be,\", \"or\", \"not\", \"to\", \"be:\", \"that\", \"is\", \"the\", \"question.\"]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Joining Words with Newlines**:\n",
    "   - The `strings.Join(words, \"\\n\")` function joins the words from the slice into a single string, placing each word on a new line.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Output**:\n",
    "   The result will appear as:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   To\n",
    "   be,\n",
    "   or\n",
    "   not\n",
    "   to\n",
