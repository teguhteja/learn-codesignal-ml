    "# Lesson 3: Mastering Conditional Logic in Loops with Go\n",
    "\n",
    "# Introduction to the Lesson\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to our exploration of **Go's `for` loop structures** and **conditional statements**. By combining these elements, you can create flexible and dynamic loops to handle various scenarios in your programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reviewing Go Loop Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Versatile `for` Loop\n",
    "The `for` loop in Go is highly versatile. It's not only used for iterating over arrays, slices, and maps but can also emulate a `while` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Standard `for` Loop\n",
    "A `for` loop iterates a predetermined number of times, much like a reliable spaceship following a set route:\n",
    "```go\n",
    "for i := 0; i < 5; i++ { // Iterates five times\n",
    "    fmt.Println(i) // Prints 0 to 4\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Emulating a `while` Loop\n",
    "To act like a `while` loop, the `for` loop eliminates initialization and increment portions:\n",
    "```go\n",
    "i := 0\n",
    "for i < 5 { // Condition for the loop to continue\n",
    "    fmt.Println(i) // Prints 0 to 4\n",
    "    i++ // Increment the counter\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reviewing Go Conditional Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `if-else` Construct\n",
    "Conditional statements in Go enable decisions to be made within your program. Here's a simple example:\n",
    "```go\n",
    "asteroidsDistance := 10\n",
    "\n",
    "if asteroidsDistance > 15 {\n",
    "    fmt.Println(\"Navigate through the asteroids.\")\n",
    "} else {\n",
    "    fmt.Println(\"Steer clear of the asteroids.\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this case, the spacecraft decides its navigation strategy based on the distance of nearby asteroids.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Combining Loops and Conditional Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1: Check for Even and Odd Numbers\n",
    "Integrate an `if-else` statement within a `for` loop to differentiate between even and odd numbers:\n",
    "```go\n",
    "for i := 0; i < 6; i++ {\n",
    "    if i % 2 == 0 {\n",
    "        fmt.Println(i, \"is even.\")  // Prints for 0, 2, 4\n",
    "    } else {\n",
    "        fmt.Println(i, \"is odd.\")   // Prints for 1, 3, 5\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2: Divisibility Check in a While-like Loop\n",
    "Here's how an `if-else` statement works in a loop that mimics a `while` structure:\n",
    "```go\n",
    "i := 0\n",
    "for i < 7 { \n",
    "    if i % 3 == 0 {\n",
    "        fmt.Println(i, \"is divisible by 3.\")  // Prints for 0, 3, 6\n",
    "    } else {\n",
    "        fmt.Println(i, \"is not divisible by 3.\")  // Prints for 1, 2, 4, 5\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    i++\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-Life Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 1: Monitoring Oxygen Levels\n",
    "In a space habitat, it's critical to monitor oxygen levels. The following example checks sensor readings:\n",
    "```go\n",
    "oxygenReadings := []float64{21.5, 20.9, 19.2, 18.0, 22.1} // Oxygen levels\n",
    "safeOxygenLevel := 19.5 // Minimum safe level in percentage\n",
    "\n",
    "for i, reading := range oxygenReadings {\n",
    "    if reading < safeOxygenLevel {\n",
    "        fmt.Printf(\"Warning! Low oxygen level at Station %d. \\n\", i+1)\n",
    "    } else {\n",
    "        fmt.Printf(\"Station %d oxygen level is safe.\\n\", i+1)\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Stations with oxygen below `safeOxygenLevel` trigger a warning.\n",
    "- Safe stations confirm normal oxygen levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2: A Space Game Simulation\n",
    "In this game, you gain points for hitting alien vessels but lose the game if you miss:\n",
    "```go\n",
    "import (\n",
    "    \"fmt\"\n",
    "    \"math/rand\"\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",

    "        if isAlienHit == 1 {\n",
    "            fmt.Println(\"Alien vessel hit! +10 points\")\n",
    "            score += 10\n",

    "        }\n",

    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Random hits/misses**: The game uses `rand.Intn(2)` to simulate hits (`1`) and misses (`0`).\n",
    "- **Scoring and termination**: The loop continues until a miss occurs.\n",

    "In our interstellar simulation, we need to categorize stars by their parity index. The provided code iterates over a series of stars, labeling each star as either \"Binary Star\" or \"Pulsar\", based on whether its index number is even or odd. Execute the code to see the approach used for this categorization!\n",

    "### Explanation of the Provided Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The code iterates over a series of stars (from `1` to `5`) and categorizes each star as either a **Binary Star** or a **Pulsar**, based on whether the starâ€™s index is **even** or **odd**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Code Walkthrough**\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "package main\n",
    "\n",
    "import (\n",
    "    \"fmt\"\n",

    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Components**:\n",
    "1. **Loop**:\n",
    "   - `for star := 1; star <= 5; star++` initializes the `star` variable at `1`, increments it by `1` on each iteration, and stops when `star > 5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Condition**:\n",
    "   - `if star % 2 == 0`: Checks whether the `star` index is divisible by `2` (even).\n",
    "   - If `true`, the star is labeled as a **Binary Star**.\n",
    "   - Otherwise, itâ€™s labeled as a **Pulsar**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Output**:\n",
    "   - Each iteration prints a message specifying the category of the star.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Expected Output**\n",
    "When you execute the program, the output will be:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Star 1 is a Pulsar.\n",
    "Star 2 is a Binary Star!\n",
    "Star 3 is a Pulsar.\n",

    "Star 5 is a Pulsar.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Insights**\n",
    "- The modulo operator (`%`) is crucial for determining even or odd indices.\n",
    "- The `for` loop iterates in a straightforward manner, making it ideal for indexed operations like categorization.\n",

    "## Converting For Loop to While Loop in Go\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's get to your hands-on practice, Stellar Coder! Convert the for loop in the starter code to a while loop to practice controlling your program's flow with a different type of loop. Ensure you maintain the same logic when monitoring the temperature of habitat modules.\n",

    "package main\n",

    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "To convert the `for` loop in your Go code into a `while` loop, you can achieve the same functionality using a `for` loop without the initialization and post-expression, as Go doesn't have a dedicated `while` keyword. Here's the modified code:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: The variable `habitatModule` is initialized to `1` before the loop.\n",
    "2. **Condition**: The `for` loop's condition `habitatModule <= 8` serves as the condition to keep looping.\n",
    "3. **Increment**: The increment `habitatModule++` is included inside the loop body to ensure progress through the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "The logic remains the same, and the program will print which habitat modules have reached the target temperature. This simulates a `while` loop by only using the conditional part of Go's `for` loop."

    "4. **Looping Through the Days**: The `for` loop iterates through each day's fuel level and prints a message based on whether the fuel level is satisfactory (greater than or equal to 80%).\n",
    "5. **If-Else Logic**: The `if` statement checks if the fuel level is sufficient and prints the appropriate message.\n",
