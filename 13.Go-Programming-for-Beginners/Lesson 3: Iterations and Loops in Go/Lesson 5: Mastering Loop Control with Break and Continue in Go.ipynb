    "# Lesson 5: Mastering Loop Control with Break and Continue in Go\n",
    "\n",
    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we are going to learn about **break** and **continue**, which are control tools used in loops in Go. The `break` command allows us to exit a loop early, while `continue` facilitates skipping unnecessary iterations. Let's dive in!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Break Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "You can liken the `break` command to the moment when the music stops in a game of musical chairs, prompting you to leave the loop. It ends the loop, irrespective of the original condition of the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {\n",
    "    if i == 7 { // When `i` reaches 7\n",
    "        fmt.Println(\"7 found! Break!\") // Message before the break\n",
    "        break                           // Terminating the loop\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    fmt.Println(\"Number:\", i) // Print i until we hit \"break\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "// Output:\n",
    "// Number: 0\n",
    "// Number: 1\n",
    "// Number: 2\n",
    "// Number: 3\n",
    "// Number: 4\n",
    "// Number: 5\n",
    "// Number: 6\n",
    "// 7 found! Break!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this loop, we iterate over numbers from `0` through `6` and break when `i` reaches `7`. The loop exits early, skipping the remaining iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Continue Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The `continue` keyword in Go can be compared to bypassing a boring view during a walk. It disregards the current loop iteration and moves ahead to the next one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "for j := 1; j <= 10; j++ {\n",
    "    if j == 4 || j == 7 { // Skip the 4th and 7th buildings\n",
    "        continue\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    fmt.Println(\"Admiring building number:\", j) // Continue with the rest\n",
    "}\n",
    "// Output:\n",
    "// Admiring building number: 1\n",
    "// Admiring building number: 2\n",
    "// Admiring building number: 3\n",
    "// Admiring building number: 5\n",
    "// Admiring building number: 6\n",
    "// Admiring building number: 8\n",
    "// Admiring building number: 9\n",
    "// Admiring building number: 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output confirms that we admire all buildings except numbers `4` and `7`, which are skipped due to the `continue` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Break and Continue in Nested Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "Nested loops are loops within loops. In these loops, `break` and `continue` work in distinct ways. Both commands only affect the inner loop, leaving the outer loop unaffected. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Break in Nested Loops:\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "for i := 1; i <= 5; i++ {\n",
    "    fmt.Print(i, \": \")\n",
    "    for j := 1; j <= 5; j++ {\n",
    "        if i == 3 && j == 3 {\n",
    "            // Break the inner loop\n",
    "            break\n",
    "        }\n",
    "        fmt.Print(j, \" \")\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    fmt.Println()\n",
    "}\n",
    "// Output:\n",
    "// 1: 1 2 3 4 5\n",
    "// 2: 1 2 3 4 5\n",
    "// 3: 1 2\n",
    "// 4: 1 2 3 4 5\n",
    "// 5: 1 2 3 4 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When `i == 3` and `j == 3`, the `break` command ends the inner loop, skipping any further iterations of `j` for that value of `i`. The outer loop continues unaffected.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Continue in Nested Loops:\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "for i := 1; i <= 5; i++ {\n",
    "    fmt.Print(i, \": \")\n",
    "    for j := 1; j <= 5; j++ {\n",
    "        if i == 3 && j == 3 {\n",
    "            continue\n",
    "        }\n",
    "        fmt.Print(j, \" \")\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    fmt.Println()\n",
    "}\n",
    "// Output:\n",
    "// 1: 1 2 3 4 5\n",
    "// 2: 1 2 3 4 5\n",
    "// 3: 1 2 4 5\n",
    "// 4: 1 2 3 4 5\n",
    "// 5: 1 2 3 4 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the `continue` skips the iteration when `i == 3` and `j == 3`. Instead of breaking the loop, it moves to the next iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lesson Summary and Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "Bravo! ðŸŽ‰ You've learned about the **break** and **continue** commands in Go, giving you greater control over loops. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "- **`break`** exits a loop entirely, regardless of the loop's condition.\n",
    "- **`continue`** skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practice:\n",
    "To master these concepts, try implementing your own scenarios with nested loops and see how `break` and `continue` behave in different situations. Happy coding! ðŸš€"
