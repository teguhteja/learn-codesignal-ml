    "\n",
    "# Introduction: Exploring Go's `for` Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "Greetings, Future Coder! Today, weâ€™ll deepen our knowledge of the Go programming language by exploring loop structures. Think of loops as paths you repeatedly walk down until you satisfy a condition. In Go, thereâ€™s only one looping keyword, the `for` loop, and it efficiently handles the functionalities typically provided by `while` and `do-while` loops in other languages.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Introduction to `for` Loops Handling `while` Functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "In Go, the `for` loop can handle tasks usually performed by `while` loops in other languages. This is achieved by using only the conditional part of the `for` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure of a `for` Loop Mimicking a `while` Loop:\n",
    "```go\n",
    "for condition {\n",
    "    // Perform some action\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Countdown from 5 to 0\n",
    "The following `for` loop behaves like a `while` loop:\n",
    "```go\n",
    "countdown := 5\n",
    "for countdown >= 0 {\n",
    "    // Print the current countdown value and decrement it by 1\n",
    "    fmt.Println(countdown)\n",
    "    countdown--\n",
    "}\n",
    "// Output:\n",
    "// 5\n",
    "// 4\n",
    "// 3\n",
    "// 2\n",
    "// 1\n",
    "// 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Point**:  \n",
    "   - The `countdown--` command ensures the loop progresses towards its termination condition.  \n",
    "   - Omitting it would result in an infinite loop, so handle with care!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to Use the `while`-Like Loop in Go\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Unlimited Iteration**\n",
    "For scenarios where the number of iterations is unknown beforehand, use a `for` loop with a condition:\n",
    "```go\n",
    "for condition {\n",
    "    // Process something until the condition is false\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Continuous State Checking**\n",
    "If you need to repeatedly check a condition until it changes, a `for` loop is ideal:\n",
    "```go\n",
    "for conditionStillTrue() {\n",
    "    // Keep processing while the condition is true\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases, Goâ€™s `for` loop seamlessly replaces the `while` loop found in other programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lesson Summary and Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "Great job! Youâ€™ve learned:\n",
    "- How Goâ€™s `for` loop can emulate `while` loops in other languages.\n",
    "- The syntax for condition-only `for` loops in Go.\n",
    "- When to use a `while`-like structure in your programs.\n",
    "\n",

    "The code replicates the behavior of a `while` loop using Go's `for` loop. It counts from `0` to `4`, simulating a sensor spotting stars.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Code Execution**\n",
    "```go\n",
    "package main\n",
    "\n",
    "import \"fmt\"\n",
    "\n",
    "func main() {\n",
    "    // A \"for\" loop to count up to 5 stars, like a sensor detecting celestial objects\n",

    "1. **Initialization**:\n",
    "   - `starsCounted` is initialized to `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Condition**:\n",
    "   - The loop continues as long as `starsCounted < 5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Body**:\n",
    "   - Inside the loop, the current count (adjusted to 1-based index) is printed as `\"Star X spotted!\"`.\n",

    "### **Key Takeaways**\n",
    "- The `for` loop structure without initialization and post statements can effectively mimic a `while` loop.\n",
