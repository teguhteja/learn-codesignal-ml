    "\n",
    "# Lesson Overview: Go's `for` Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to our lesson on Go's `for` loop. Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly. A `for` loop is ideal for repetitive tasks, like reading each page of a book one after another. By the end of this journey, you'll understand and be able to use the basic `for` loop and the `range` clause in Go.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Understanding the Basic `for` Loop in Go\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine counting your favorite collection of stickers. You take one, count it, and continue until all are counted. This process resembles how the basic `for` loop works in Go!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax:\n",
    "```go\n",
    "for initialization; condition; post {\n",
    "    // Some tasks to do\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works:\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: A starting point is executed.\n",
    "2. **Condition**: The loop continues as long as this evaluates to `true`.\n",
    "3. **Post**: After each iteration, a step (e.g., increment) is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Printing Numbers 1 to 5\n",
    "```go\n",
    "for i := 1; i <= 5; i++ {\n",
    "    fmt.Println(i)\n",
    "}\n",
    "// Prints:\n",
    "// 1\n",
    "// 2\n",
    "// 3\n",
    "// 4\n",
    "// 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explanation**:  \n",
    "   1. The variable `i` is initialized to `1`.  \n",
    "   2. The loop runs as long as `i <= 5`.  \n",
    "   3. After each iteration, `i` is incremented (`i++`).\n",

    "## Using the `Range` Clause in Go: Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "The `range` clause is used to loop through items in data structures like arrays, slices, strings, maps, or channels. It's like scanning an image for shapesâ€”you go through the entire image systematically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Printing Elements of an Array\n",

    "for index, num := range numbers {\n",
    "    fmt.Println(\"element at index\", index, \"equals\", num)\n",
    "}\n",
    "// Prints:\n",
    "// element at index 0 equals 5\n",
    "// element at index 1 equals 4\n",
    "// element at index 2 equals 3\n",
    "// element at index 3 equals 2\n",
    "// element at index 4 equals 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using the `Range` Clause in Go: Part 2\n",
    "\n",
    "When you don't need the index, you can use `_` (a blank identifier) to ignore it and focus on the values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Printing Only the Values\n",
    "```go\n",
    "numbers := []int{5, 4, 3, 2, 1}\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Slice Creation**:\n",
    "   - A slice named `planets` contains a list of planet names.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Basic `for` Loop**:\n",
    "   - Iterates through the slice using the index.\n",
    "   - Accesses each planet by its index (`planets[i]`).\n",
    "   - Prints: `\"Visiting planet: <planet_name>\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`Range` Clause**:\n",
    "   - Iterates directly over the elements of the slice.\n",
    "   - The `_` ignores the index, and `planet` represents each element in the slice.\n",
    "   - Prints: `\"Visiting planet: <planet_name>\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Output\n",
    "When you execute this code, it prints the names of all planets twice (once for each loop method):\n",

    "   - Useful when you need the index or have a more complex iteration logic.\n",

    "2. **Using `Range` Clause**:\n",
    "   - Simplifies the iteration when you only need the elements.\n",

    "### **Explanation of Fixes:**\n",
    "1. **Loop Condition:**  \n",
    "   - Use `i < len(stickers)` to ensure the loop runs only up to the last valid index of the `stickers` slice.\n",
    "   - `i <= len(stickers)` causes an out-of-bounds access when `i` equals `len(stickers)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Increment Operator:**  \n",

    "\n",
    "### **Alternative Approach: Range-Based Loop**\n",
