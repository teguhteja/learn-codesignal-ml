    "# Lesson 4: Mastering Nested Loops in Go\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s the refined version of your text in Markdown format:\n",
    "\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Greetings! This lesson is instrumental in mastering nested loops in Go. Similar to how our daily routine might involve multiple tasks (inner loops) that we repeat for every day of the week (outer loop), nested loops in programming involve the execution of an inner loop within an outer loop. Let's kick things off!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Nested Loops: The Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose your day involves multiple tasks like cooking and eating for each meal: breakfast, lunch, and dinner. In this case, the meals represent the outer loop, while the tasks constitute the inner loop. Similarly, in Go, we can write a `for` loop (inner loop) inside another `for` loop (outer loop).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Go Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "for initialization; condition; iteration {\n",
    "    // outer loop code\n",
    "    for initialization; condition; iteration {\n",
    "        // inner loop code\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The program evaluates the condition of the outer loop. If it's true, it enters the loop and executes the inner loop to completion before moving on to the next iteration of the outer loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Go Nested `for` Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing nested `for` loops in Go is straightforward. To demonstrate, let's print a 5x5 star pattern using nested loops:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Go Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {\n",
    "    for j := 0; j <= i; j++ {\n",
    "        fmt.Print(\"* \") // print \"* \"\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    fmt.Println() // move to the next line\n",
    "}\n",
    "// Prints:\n",
    "// *\n",
    "// * *\n",
    "// * * *\n",
    "// * * * *\n",
    "// * * * * *\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this instance, the outer loop governs the rows, while the inner loop controls the columns. The result is a diagonal pattern of stars printed in the console!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Emulating `while` Loops in Go\n",
    "\n",
    "As Go doesn't feature a distinct `while` keyword, we utilize the `for` loop to mimic the behavior of a `while` loop. Nested `for` loops that emulate `while` loops function precisely like the nested `for` loops we covered earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Go Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "i := 5\n",
    "for i > 0 {\n",
    "    j := i\n",
    "    for j > 0 {\n",
    "        fmt.Print(j, \" \") // print the number\n",
    "        j--\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    fmt.Println() // move to the next line\n",
    "    i--\n",
    "}\n",
    "// Prints:\n",
    "// 5 4 3 2 1\n",
    "// 4 3 2 1\n",
    "// 3 2 1\n",
    "// 2 1\n",
    "// 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon executing this, you'll notice five lines, each containing decreasing numbers, just as the comment explains.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advanced Tasks with Nested Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "Nested loops are particularly effective for tasks such as traversing multi-dimensional arrays and executing complex searches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a 2D slice, let's print all elements using nested loops:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Go Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "intArray := [][]int{{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}}\n",
    "\n",
    "for i := 0; i < len(intArray); i++ { // iterates over rows\n",
    "    for j := 0; j < len(intArray[i]); j++ { // iterates over columns\n",
    "        fmt.Print(intArray[i][j], \" \") // prints each element\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    fmt.Println() // moves to the next line\n",
    "}\n",
    "// Prints:\n",
    "// 1 2 3\n",
    "// 4 5 6\n",
    "// 7 8 9\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To search for an integer in a 2D slice, nested loops again come in handy. Here's a demonstration that searches for the number 7:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Go Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "intArray := [][]int{{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}}\n",
    "searchNumber := 7\n",
    "isFound := false\n",
    "\n",
    "for i := 0; i < len(intArray); i++ { // iterates over rows\n",
    "    for j := 0; j < len(intArray[i]); j++ { // iterates over columns\n",
    "        if intArray[i][j] == searchNumber {\n",
    "            fmt.Println(\"Number\", searchNumber, \"found at [\", i, \", \", j, \"]\")\n",
    "            isFound = true\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "if !isFound {\n",
    "    fmt.Println(\"Number\", searchNumber, \"not found in the array.\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "// Prints: Number 7 found at [ 2 , 0 ]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon running the code, our nested loops locate and identify the number 7 in the third row.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quick Nested Loops Tips and Warnings\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though nested loops are incredibly useful, be cautious to avoid pitfalls such as infinite loops. A loop will turn into an infinite one if it isn't designed carefully to eventually terminate. Remember, proper controls and conditional statements are crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lesson Summary and Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "Well done! You now understand the concept of nested loops and can effectively use `for` loops in Go. Shortly, you'll commence work on practice exercises to deepen your understanding of loops in Go. Happy coding!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Changes:\n",
    "- Organized the content with proper headings (`#` and `##`).\n",
    "- Applied code block syntax using triple backticks (```) for Go code examples.\n",
    "- Corrected minor wording and formatting issues for readability."

    "## Transforming For Loop to While-style For Loop in Go\n",
    "\n",
    "Stellar Coder, your new objective is to modify the code that prints the countdown numbers from a for loop to using a for loop that operates similarly to a while loop in Go. Ensure the number of countdown lines remains the same and that the output formatting is consistent with the original. Let's get to work!\n",

    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how to transform the given `for` loop into a `while-style` loop in Go. In Go, `while` loops don’t exist explicitly, but `for` loops without initialization and post statements act as `while` loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modified Code:\n",
    "```go\n",
    "package main\n",
    "\n",
    "import \"fmt\"\n",
    "\n",
    "func main() {\n",
    "    i := 5\n",
    "    for i > 0 { // While-style for loop\n",
    "        fmt.Println(\"Countdown\", i, \":\")\n",
    "        j := i\n",
    "        for j > 0 { // Inner while-style for loop\n",

    "        i--\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Changes:\n",
    "1. **Outer Loop:**\n",
    "   - Replaced `for i := 5; i > 0; i--` with:\n",
    "     ```go\n",
    "     i := 5\n",
    "     for i > 0 {\n",
    "         // logic\n",
    "         i--\n",
    "     }\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inner Loop:**\n",
    "   - Replaced `for j := i; j > 0; j--` with:\n",
    "     ```go\n",
    "     j := i\n",
    "     for j > 0 {\n",
    "         // logic\n",
    "         j--\n",
    "     }\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output:\n",
    "The output remains consistent with the original code:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Countdown 5 :\n",
    "-  5\n",
    "-  4\n",
    "-  3\n",
    "-  2\n",
    "-  1\n",
    "Countdown 4 :\n",
    "-  4\n",
    "-  3\n",
    "-  2\n",
    "-  1\n",
    "Countdown 3 :\n",
    "-  3\n",
    "-  2\n",
    "-  1\n",
    "Countdown 2 :\n",
    "-  2\n",
    "-  1\n",
    "Countdown 1 :\n",
    "-  1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "By initializing variables (`i`, `j`) outside the `for` loop and only providing a condition (`i > 0` or `j > 0`), the loop behaves like a `while` loop."
