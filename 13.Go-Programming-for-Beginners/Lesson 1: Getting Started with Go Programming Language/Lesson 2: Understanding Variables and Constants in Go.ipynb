    "# Lesson 2: Understanding Variables and Constants in Go\n",
    " \n",
    "# Topic Overview and Goal Setting\n",
    "\n",
    "Greetings! As we venture into our Go Programming Expedition, we're setting out to understand **Go Variables**, our essential assistants. Similar to coordinates on a map, variables guide our code, endowing it with data and meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, a variable in coding is akin to a ticket — a reserved place in memory where a value can be stored. This lesson aims to demystify the concept of Go variables, examining their definition, naming conventions, assignment operations, and the concept of constant variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are Go Variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of Go variables as tickets, each carrying specific data. The following short example illustrates how a variable is defined in Go:\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "var numOfMountainPeaks int // We declare a variable, similar to buying a ticket\n",
    "numOfMountainPeaks = 14    // We then assign it a value\n",
    "fmt.Println(numOfMountainPeaks) // Finally, we validate its contents. It outputs: 14\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `int` is the data type of the variable (integer), `numOfMountainPeaks` is the variable's name, and `14` is its value. We will delve deeper into data types in the upcoming lesson, so don't fret if the `int` part is somewhat unclear now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can declare and assign the variable in one step like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "var numOfMountainPeaks = 14 // Declaring and assigning the variable at once\n",
    "fmt.Println(numOfMountainPeaks)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or using a short declaration:\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "numOfMountainPeaks := 14 // Creating and assigning the variable with shorthand\n",
    "fmt.Println(numOfMountainPeaks)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### To sum up, here are all the ways to initialize a variable:\n",
    "- **Declaring without initializing**: `var name int`\n",
    "- **Declaring and Initializing**: `var name = 5`\n",
    "- **Short Declaring and Initializing**: `name := 5`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Go Naming Conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as with correctly labeling a ticket, naming a Go variable requires adherence to certain rules and conventions. These assist us in keeping our code error-free and easily interpreted by others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Go's variable name rules follow the **CamelCase** convention:\n",
    "- If the variable name contains a single word, all letters should be lowercase.\n",
    "- If the variable name comprises multiple words, the first one should be lowercase, and each subsequent one should start with a capital letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: `age`, `weight`, `myAge`, `firstDayOfWeek`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Special characters and digits are **not permitted** at the start of variable names.\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "// Correct variable naming\n",
    "var myWeight int = 72\n",
    "var district9Population int = 10000\n",
    "myAge := 20\n",
    "\n",
    "// Incorrect variable naming (commented intentionally)\n",
    "// var 0zero = 0;\n",
    "// var ?questionMark = 1;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment Operations in Go\n",
    "\n",
    "Assigning in Go involves allocating or updating a variable's value using the `=` operator. This act is analogous to stamping a ticket.\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "var constellations = 88 // We secure a ticket, label it, and assign a value\n",
    "fmt.Println(constellations) // We check the content. It outputs: 88\n",
    "\n",
    "constellations = 77 // We modify the value of the variable\n",
    "fmt.Println(constellations) // We review the updated content. It outputs: 77\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Go Constants\n",
    "\n",
    "While the previous section describes how to change a variable's value, Go also provides a method to define **constants** — variables that cannot alter their value once assigned. We use the `const` keyword to declare a constant. Constants are generally named using uppercase letters, and words are separated by underscores `_`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Declaring a value as `const` is a common practice when you know it won't change, thereby enhancing readability, providing safety (avoiding accidental changes), and sometimes improving performance reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "const DAYS_IN_WEEK = 7 // We define a constant, similar to etching a fact on a monument\n",
    "fmt.Println(DAYS_IN_WEEK) // We examine our immutable fact. It outputs: 7\n",
    "\n",
    "// DAYS_IN_WEEK = 6; // This will not compile\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `DAYS_IN_WEEK` serves as a constant, disallowing adjustments once assigned. The value for this variable cannot be changed after its assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lesson Recap and Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Great job! You've now gained insights into the basics of variables and constants in Go. In our upcoming lessons, we'll apply these concepts through practical exercises. Practicing is indeed crucial for transforming knowledge into skill, so let's delve into the tasks and continue our Go Programming Expedition!\n"

    "## Exploring Go: Variables and Constants of Our Planet\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will practice using Go variables and constants to store and display key attributes of Earth. Your mission is to declare a constant that holds the number of continents on Earth, and a variable that stores the age of Earth in billions of years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Execute the code to uncover these terrestrial facts!\n",
    "\n",
    "package main\n",

    "\n",
    "func main() {\n",

    "\n",
    "    var earthAge = 4\n",
    "    fmt.Println(\"Earth is approximately\", earthAge, \"billion years old.\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "The Go code you've written introduces the use of a constant and a variable to represent key attributes of Earth. Here's an explanation and the completed code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "package main\n",
    "\n",
    "import (\n",
    "    \"fmt\"\n",

    "\n",

    "    fmt.Println(\"Earth is approximately\", earthAge, \"billion years old.\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "- `const NUMBER_OF_CONTINENTS = 7`: This declares a constant named `NUMBER_OF_CONTINENTS` with a value of `7`. Constants are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed once assigned.\n",
    "- `var earthAge = 4`: This declares a variable named `earthAge` and assigns it a value of `4`, representing the approximate age of Earth in billions of years. Variables can be modified if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running the Code:\n",
    "- When executed, this code will display:\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Number of continents on Earth: 7\n",
    "  Earth is approximately 4 billion years old.\n",
    "  ```\n",

    "## Defining and Using Constants in Go\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we're looking at defining constants in Go, which, like the universal constant of gravity, do not change. Convert the provided starter code to define the gravitational constant as a constant using the proper Go syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "package main\n",
    "\n",
    "import \"fmt\"\n",

    "    // Output the gravitational constant\n",
    "    fmt.Println(\"The gravitational constant is:\", gravitationalConst)\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "To define the gravitational constant as a true constant in Go, you need to use the `const` keyword. Here's how to modify the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "package main\n",
    "\n",
    "import \"fmt\"\n",
    "\n",
    "func main() {\n",
    "    // Defining the gravitational constant as a constant\n",
    "    const gravitationalConst = 6.674\n",

    "    fmt.Println(\"The gravitational constant is:\", gravitationalConst)\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "- `const gravitationalConst = 6.674`: The `const` keyword is used to declare `gravitationalConst` as a constant. This means that the value `6.674` cannot be changed throughout the program.\n",
    "- Constants in Go are typically used for values that are not expected to change, making your code more robust and easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running the Code:\n",
    "- When executed, this code will display:\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  The gravitational constant is: 6.674\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "By using a constant, you ensure that the gravitational constant remains immutable, reflecting its unchanging nature in the universe."
