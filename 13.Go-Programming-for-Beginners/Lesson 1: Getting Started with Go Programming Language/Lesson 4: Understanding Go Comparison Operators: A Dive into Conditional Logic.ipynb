    "# Lesson 4: Understanding Go Comparison Operators: A Dive into Conditional Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "# Lesson Introduction and Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "Greetings! Today, we're venturing into the rewarding realm of **Go comparison operators**. These operators are of paramount importance as they control the flow of code by enabling value comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal for this session is to deepen our understanding of the usage of comparison operators in Go programs. We will investigate various Go comparison operators and reinforce your learning through real-world examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploring Go Comparison Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine operating a submarine in the deep sea. Here, you determine your routes by evaluating conditions such as the distances to underwater landmarks. These decisions boil down to comparisons, similar to situations encountered in programming. In Go, we use comparison operators to facilitate such rational decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Go programming language includes six comparison operators:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `==`: **Equal to**\n",
    "- `!=`: **Not equal to**\n",
    "- `>`: **Greater than**\n",
    "- `<`: **Less than**\n",
    "- `>=`: **Greater than or equal to**\n",
    "- `<=`: **Less than or equal to**\n",
    "\n",
    "These operators return either `true` or `false`, also known as Boolean values.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Submarine Speed Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "var submarineSpeed = 30  // speed in knots\n",
    "var currentSpeed = 20    // speed in knots\n",
    "\n",
    "fmt.Println(\"Is the submarine faster than the ocean current? \", submarineSpeed > currentSpeed)\n",
    "// Prints: Is the submarine faster than the ocean current? true\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, we used the `>` operator to compare `submarineSpeed` and `currentSpeed`. The result is `true` because `submarineSpeed` is greater than `currentSpeed`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploring `==` and `!=` Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's delve into the **equal to (`==`)** and **not equal to (`!=`)** operators. These are crucial when you need to compare values, such as the current oxygen level with the desired one:\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "var currentOxygenLevel = 70  // current oxygen level in %\n",
    "var requiredOxygenLevel = 100  // required oxygen level in %\n",
    "\n",
    "var isOxygenEnough = currentOxygenLevel == requiredOxygenLevel  // this results in 'false'\n",
    "var isOxygenLow = currentOxygenLevel != requiredOxygenLevel  // this results in 'true'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `==` operator checks if `currentOxygenLevel` equals `requiredOxygenLevel`, yielding `false`.\n",
    "- The `!=` operator verifies their inequality, returning `true`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploring `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=` Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "These operators are primarily used for numeric data comparisons. Suppose you're surveying two underwater caves and want to determine which one is closer:\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "var distanceToCaveA = 2000 // distance in meters\n",
    "var distanceToCaveB = 1000 // distance in meters\n",
    "\n",
    "var isACloser = distanceToCaveA < distanceToCaveB  // this results in 'false'\n",
    "var isBCloserOrSame = distanceToCaveA >= distanceToCaveB  // this results in 'true'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- The submarine is not closer to cave A, so `isACloser` is `false`.\n",
    "- The submarine is closer to, or at the same distance from, cave B â€” `isBCloserOrSame` is `true`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lesson Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Excellent work! We've embarked on an exploration of the **Go comparison operators** and their practical applications. Armed with this knowledge, you can now make decisions and effectively control the flow of your Go programs.\n",

    "\n",
    "The provided code checks if the submarine is navigating below the safe depth. Modify the starter code to verify if the submarine has exceeded the critical depth limit for safe operation. You will need to replace the comparison operator and revise the variable name to accurately reflect the updated logic.\n",

    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the modified code to check if the submarine has exceeded the critical depth limit for safe operation:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "func main() {\n",

    "\n",
    "    // Create a new boolean variable \"isTooDeepForSafety\" and update the print statement accordingly\n",
    "    isTooDeepForSafety := submarineDepth > criticalSafeDepth\n",
    "    fmt.Println(\"Has the submarine exceeded the critical depth limit for safety? \", isTooDeepForSafety)\n",
    "    // If submarineDepth is 350, it will print: Has the submarine exceeded the critical depth limit for safety? true\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Changes Made:\n",
    "- **Updated Variable Name**: Changed `withinSafeDepth` to `isTooDeepForSafety` to better reflect the updated logic.\n",
    "- **Modified Comparison Operator**: Changed `<=` to `>` to check if the submarine has exceeded the critical depth.\n",
    "- **Updated Print Statement**: Adjusted the message to clarify that it checks if the submarine has exceeded the safety limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the code will correctly indicate whether the submarine is too deep to be considered safe."
