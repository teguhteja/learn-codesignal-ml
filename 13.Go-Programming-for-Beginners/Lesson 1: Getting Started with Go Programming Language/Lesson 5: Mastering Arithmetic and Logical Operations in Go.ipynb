    "# Lesson 5: Mastering Arithmetic and Logical Operations in Go\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Lesson Overview\n",
    "Fasten your seatbelts, coder! Today, we're immersing ourselves in Go, mastering arithmetic and logical operations on primitive types. These abilities are vital for data manipulation and decision-making during our coding adventure.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Arithmetic Operations Exposed\n",
    "Remember that Go's primitive data types include `int` for whole numbers, `float64` for decimal numbers, `bool` for true/false values, and `string` for textual content. Both `int` and `float64` exhibit constraints in their numerical spans, which we'll explore when we discuss overflow later in this lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can perform arithmetic operations — addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), division (`/`), and modulus (the remainder of the division `%`) — on numerical types. Here's how we do it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "package main\n",
    "\n",
    "import \"fmt\"\n",
    "\n",
    "func main() {\n",
    "    var a int = 10\n",
    "    var b int = 2\n",
    "    fmt.Println(a + b) // Outputs: 12\n",
    "    fmt.Println(a - b) // Outputs: 8\n",
    "    fmt.Println(a * b) // Outputs: 20\n",
    "    fmt.Println(a / b) // Outputs: 5\n",
    "    fmt.Println(a % b) // Outputs: 0\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Go supports altering the order of operations using parentheses and provides the modulus (`%`) operation, which is handy for determining whether numbers are even or odd!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Logical Operations Demystified\n",
    "Logical operators — `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), `!` (NOT) — function as decision-makers in Go, returning `bool` values: `true` or `false`. Here's how we can use them with two `bool` variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "package main\n",
    "\n",
    "import \"fmt\"\n",
    "\n",
    "func main() {\n",
    "    fmt.Println(true && true)   // true\n",
    "    fmt.Println(true && false)  // false\n",
    "    fmt.Println(false && true)  // false\n",
    "    fmt.Println(false && false) // false\n",
    "\n",
    "    fmt.Println(true || true)   // true\n",
    "    fmt.Println(true || false)  // true\n",
    "    fmt.Println(false || true)  // true\n",
    "    fmt.Println(false || false) // false\n",
    "\n",
    "    fmt.Println(!true)  // false\n",
    "    fmt.Println(!false) // true\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case:\n",
    "- `&&` yields `true` only if both boolean inputs are `true`.\n",
    "- `||` outputs `true` if either of the inputs is `true`.\n",
    "- `!` reverses the boolean value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary use of logical operations is with variables. Let's illustrate a simple example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "package main\n",
    "\n",
    "import \"fmt\"\n",
    "\n",
    "func main() {\n",
    "    var speed int = 60\n",
    "    var minSpeed int = 30\n",
    "    var maxSpeed int = 70\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Check if the speed is within the accepted range.\n",
    "    fmt.Println(speed > minSpeed && speed < maxSpeed) // Prints: true\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overflow Phenomenon\n",
    "The concept of **overflow** explains what happens when we exceed the range allocation of an integer variable. It occurs when we attempt to store a value that surpasses the capacity of the variable's type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "package main\n",
    "\n",
    "import (\n",
    "    \"fmt\"\n",
    "    \"math\"\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "func main() {\n",
    "    var maxInt int = math.MaxInt32 // The maximum integer, equivalent to 2^31 - 1\n",
    "    var overflow int = maxInt + 1  // Causes an overflow; there's no integer after the maximal one\n",
    "    fmt.Println(overflow)          // Prints: -2147483648, which is -2^31 - the minimum integer value\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `maxInt` is the largest integer value that `int` can encapsulate. Note that we need to import `\"math\"` to use `math.MaxInt32`. When we increment it by one, it 'overflows' to the lowest possible integer value, reminding us that integer values are cyclic in nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lesson Summary\n",
    "Well done! Today, we unveiled arithmetic operations, made intricate decisions using logical operators, and became familiar with the effects of overflow. Up next are some practice exercises to reinforce these crucial concepts in Go. Coders, it's time to start hacking!\n",

    "## Exploring Integer Overflow in Go\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code demonstrates what happens when we add 10 to the maximum value of an `int32` in Go, showcasing the effects of integer overflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "package main\n",
    "\n",
    "import (\n",
    "    \"fmt\"\n",
    "    \"math\"\n",
    ")\n",

    "    fmt.Println(\"Result after adding 10 to MaxInt32:\", result)\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "- `math.MaxInt32` is the largest value that `int32` can hold, which is `2,147,483,647`.\n",
    "- When you add 10 to `maxIntVal`, the value surpasses the upper limit of `int32`. Since integer overflow occurs, the result wraps around to the negative range of `int32`, producing an unexpected value.\n",
    "- **Output**:\n",
    "  - The first `fmt.Println` will display the maximum int32 value: `2147483647`.\n",
    "  - The second `fmt.Println` will output a negative result, illustrating overflow behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates how crucial it is to manage integer limits carefully in programming, as overflow can lead to unexpected and potentially hazardous results."
