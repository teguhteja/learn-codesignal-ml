    "# Lesson 7: Navigating Go's Conditional Cosmos: Steering Through if-else and Beyond\n",
    "\n",
    "# Charting Our Coding Trajectory: Overview of Conditional Statements in Go\n",
    "\n",
    "Greetings, Go astronaut in training! Today's itinerary includes studying the mainstay of programming control flow: **conditional statements**. These mechanisms steer the course of our Go program. Are you strapped in and ready to explore the `if-else` statement? Let's start the countdown now!\n",

    "\n",
    "## üöÄ Mapping the If and If-Else Constellation\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of `if` and `if-else` control flow in Go is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "if condition {\n",
    "    // action if condition is true\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// additionally\n",
    "\n",
    "if condition {\n",
    "    // action if condition is true\n",
    "} else {\n",
    "    // action if condition is false\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, when the given condition becomes `true`, we take action via the `if` block. When the condition is `false`, we have an optional `else` block to resort to.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üåå Probing the Nebula of Go's If-Else Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the `if` statement in Go, we command the machine to undertake specific actions only when conditions are met. For example, deciding to land on a planet with breathable air:\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "var oxygenLevel = 78 // The level of oxygen on the planet\n",
    "\n",
    "if oxygenLevel > 20 {\n",
    "    fmt.Println(\"Planet has breathable air!\") // Oxygen level is suitable\n",
    "} else {\n",
    "    fmt.Println(\"Oxygen level too low!\") // Oxygen level is not high enough\n",
    "}\n",
    "// Output: Planet has breathable air!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "- The statement `if oxygenLevel > 20` tests if the oxygen level is greater than 20.\n",
    "- If the test passes (`true`), it prints: **\"Planet has breathable air!\"**.\n",
    "- If it fails (`false`), the `else` clause executes and prints: **\"Oxygen level too low!\"**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚ú® Multiple Conditions: The Else If Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with multiple conditions, we can use `else if`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "var oxygenLevel = 58\n",
    "if oxygenLevel > 70 {\n",
    "    fmt.Println(\"Excellent Oxygen level!\")\n",
    "} else if oxygenLevel > 50 {\n",
    "    fmt.Println(\"Oxygen level is acceptable.\")\n",
    "} else {\n",
    "    fmt.Println(\"Oxygen level is too low!\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "// Output: Oxygen level is acceptable.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points:\n",
    "- The `else if` keyword helps evaluate alternative conditions.\n",
    "- The first condition that evaluates to `true` triggers the associated action.\n",
    "- Once a condition is met, the program ignores subsequent `else if` conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## üõ∞Ô∏è Navigating Through Interstellar Switches\n",
    "\n",
    "In Go, a `switch` statement checks multiple conditions in a concise and readable format. It is similar to `if, else if, else`, but more structured.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Format of Switch:\n",
    "```go\n",
    "switch condition {\n",
    "    case condition_1:\n",
    "        // action if condition_1 is true\n",
    "    case condition_2:\n",
    "        // action if condition_2 is true\n",
    "    default:\n",
    "        // action if none of the conditions are met\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```go\n",
    "var planet = \"Mars\"\n",
    "\n",
    "switch planet {\n",
    "    case \"Earth\":\n",
    "        fmt.Println(\"Planet is Earth.\")\n",
    "    case \"Mars\":\n",
    "        fmt.Println(\"Planet is Mars.\")\n",
    "    default:\n",
    "        fmt.Println(\"Unidentified Planet.\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "// Output: Planet is Mars.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "- The `switch` tests the value of `planet`.\n",
    "- The first matching case executes the corresponding code.\n",
    "- If no case matches, the `default` block executes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üåç Multiple Values in Switch\n",
    "\n",
    "A case statement in Go can have multiple comma-separated values:\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "food := \"apple\"\n",
    "\n",
    "switch food {\n",
    "    case \"apple\", \"banana\", \"orange\":\n",
    "        fmt.Println(food, \"is a fruit.\")\n",
    "    case \"carrot\", \"broccoli\", \"radish\":\n",
    "        fmt.Println(food, \"is a vegetable.\")\n",
    "    case \"chicken\", \"beef\", \"fish\":\n",
    "        fmt.Println(food, \"is a meat.\")\n",
    "    default:\n",
    "        fmt.Println(\"Unknown food category.\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Output: apple is a fruit\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "- If any value in a case statement matches the variable (`food`), the associated block executes.\n",
    "- For `apple`, the program identifies it as a fruit.\n",
