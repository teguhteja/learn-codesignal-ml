    "# Lesson 7: Navigating Go's Conditional Cosmos: Steering Through if-else and Beyond\n",
    "\n",
    "# Charting Our Coding Trajectory: Overview of Conditional Statements in Go\n",
    "\n",
    "Greetings, Go astronaut in training! Today's itinerary includes studying the mainstay of programming control flow: **conditional statements**. These mechanisms steer the course of our Go program. Are you strapped in and ready to explore the `if-else` statement? Let's start the countdown now!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 Mapping the If and If-Else Constellation\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of `if` and `if-else` control flow in Go is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "if condition {\n",
    "    // action if condition is true\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// additionally\n",
    "\n",
    "if condition {\n",
    "    // action if condition is true\n",
    "} else {\n",
    "    // action if condition is false\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, when the given condition becomes `true`, we take action via the `if` block. When the condition is `false`, we have an optional `else` block to resort to.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🌌 Probing the Nebula of Go's If-Else Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the `if` statement in Go, we command the machine to undertake specific actions only when conditions are met. For example, deciding to land on a planet with breathable air:\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "var oxygenLevel = 78 // The level of oxygen on the planet\n",
    "\n",
    "if oxygenLevel > 20 {\n",
    "    fmt.Println(\"Planet has breathable air!\") // Oxygen level is suitable\n",
    "} else {\n",
    "    fmt.Println(\"Oxygen level too low!\") // Oxygen level is not high enough\n",
    "}\n",
    "// Output: Planet has breathable air!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "- The statement `if oxygenLevel > 20` tests if the oxygen level is greater than 20.\n",
    "- If the test passes (`true`), it prints: **\"Planet has breathable air!\"**.\n",
    "- If it fails (`false`), the `else` clause executes and prints: **\"Oxygen level too low!\"**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✨ Multiple Conditions: The Else If Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with multiple conditions, we can use `else if`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "var oxygenLevel = 58\n",
    "if oxygenLevel > 70 {\n",
    "    fmt.Println(\"Excellent Oxygen level!\")\n",
    "} else if oxygenLevel > 50 {\n",
    "    fmt.Println(\"Oxygen level is acceptable.\")\n",
    "} else {\n",
    "    fmt.Println(\"Oxygen level is too low!\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "// Output: Oxygen level is acceptable.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points:\n",
    "- The `else if` keyword helps evaluate alternative conditions.\n",
    "- The first condition that evaluates to `true` triggers the associated action.\n",
    "- Once a condition is met, the program ignores subsequent `else if` conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛰️ Navigating Through Interstellar Switches\n",
    "\n",
    "In Go, a `switch` statement checks multiple conditions in a concise and readable format. It is similar to `if, else if, else`, but more structured.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Format of Switch:\n",
    "```go\n",
    "switch condition {\n",
    "    case condition_1:\n",
    "        // action if condition_1 is true\n",
    "    case condition_2:\n",
    "        // action if condition_2 is true\n",
    "    default:\n",
    "        // action if none of the conditions are met\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```go\n",
    "var planet = \"Mars\"\n",
    "\n",
    "switch planet {\n",
    "    case \"Earth\":\n",
    "        fmt.Println(\"Planet is Earth.\")\n",
    "    case \"Mars\":\n",
    "        fmt.Println(\"Planet is Mars.\")\n",
    "    default:\n",
    "        fmt.Println(\"Unidentified Planet.\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "// Output: Planet is Mars.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "- The `switch` tests the value of `planet`.\n",
    "- The first matching case executes the corresponding code.\n",
    "- If no case matches, the `default` block executes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🌍 Multiple Values in Switch\n",
    "\n",
    "A case statement in Go can have multiple comma-separated values:\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "food := \"apple\"\n",
    "\n",
    "switch food {\n",
    "    case \"apple\", \"banana\", \"orange\":\n",
    "        fmt.Println(food, \"is a fruit.\")\n",
    "    case \"carrot\", \"broccoli\", \"radish\":\n",
    "        fmt.Println(food, \"is a vegetable.\")\n",
    "    case \"chicken\", \"beef\", \"fish\":\n",
    "        fmt.Println(food, \"is a meat.\")\n",
    "    default:\n",
    "        fmt.Println(\"Unknown food category.\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Output: apple is a fruit\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "- If any value in a case statement matches the variable (`food`), the associated block executes.\n",
    "- For `apple`, the program identifies it as a fruit.\n",

    "1. **Planet Temperature**: The code checks the average temperature of the planet (`planetTemperature`) and assigns a safety category based on thresholds:\n",
    "   - **Above 270 K**: \"Habitable Zone\" (suitable for human habitation).\n",
    "   - **201 to 270 K**: \"Marginal Conditions\" (challenging but potentially survivable).\n",
    "   - **200 K or below**: \"Inhospitable Zone\" (not fit for human habitation).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Current Scenario**: The code sets the `planetTemperature` to 287 K, which falls into the \"Habitable Zone.\"\n",

    "### Execution Result\n",
    "Running the code with the provided temperature results in:\n",

    "```\n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "The exoplanet, with an average temperature of 287 K, is categorized as being in the \"Habitable Zone.\" This suggests that it has conditions suitable for human habitation, such as liquid water and a moderate temperature range. This makes it a promising candidate for a colony mission!"

    "1. **Syntax Error in `else if` Clause**:\n",
    "   - The line `else temperature < 20 {` is invalid syntax. Go requires explicit `if` following `else` to check a condition.\n",
    "   - The correct syntax is `else if temperature < 20 {`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Missing `if` Statement in the `else` Block**:\n",
    "   - The condition must be checked explicitly after `else` if you want to branch further based on conditions.\n",

    "### Explanation of Fix\n",
