    "# Lesson 3: Navigating Logical Errors in Go\n",
    "\n",
    "Hereâ€™s a refined version of your markdown text with clear formatting, proper sectioning, and consistent styling:  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# Introduction  \n",
    "Hello, get ready for some programming intrigue! We're about to delve into **logical errors in Go**. These subtle bugs don't cause your program to crash or display error messages, but they cause it to behave in ways you did not anticipate.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine programming a vending machine to dispense soda, but it provides coffee instead. That's a classic example of a logical error! Shall we uncover these silent disruptors?  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding Logical Errors  \n",
    "Logical errors are mistakes in your program that result in unintended outcomes. They do not relate to syntax, so your program will compile and run without errors.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "If you use the humidity index as the temperature in a weather app, it would be a logical error. Although the program would run without any apparent issues, the results would be illogical and incorrect.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recognizing Logical Errors  \n",
    "To identify logical errors, one must watch out for unexpected behavior. For example, consider this Go code:  \n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "for i := 1; i <= 10; i++ {  \n",
    "    i = i - 1\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance, it may seem that this loop should run ten times. However, this code will produce an **infinite loop** as `i` continuously resets to 1, which is always less than 10.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This issue is a logical error, and it can be challenging to spot because Go reports no syntax or run-time errors for this code.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Debugging Logical Errors  \n",
    "To debug a logical error, inspect the program's state to understand why its behavior deviates from expectations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example with logging statements:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "import \"fmt\"\n",
    "\n",
    "fmt.Println(\"Starting the loop\")\n",
    "for i := 1; i <= 10; i++ {  \n",
    "    fmt.Println(\"Processing: \", i) \n",
    "    i = i - 1\n",
    "}\n",
    "fmt.Println(\"Loop finished\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By adding `fmt.Println(\"Processing: \", i)`, you can reveal the value of `i` with each iteration. This helps identify that `i` resets to 1 in each iteration, causing the loop to become infinite.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fixing Logical Errors  \n",
    "After identifying a logical error, the next step is to correct it. Using the previous example, the fix is to **remove the decrement of `i` from the loop**:  \n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "import \"fmt\"\n",
    "\n",
    "fmt.Println(\"Starting the loop\")\n",
    "for i := 1; i <= 10; i++ {  \n",
    "    fmt.Println(\"Processing: \", i) \n",
    "}\n",
    "fmt.Println(\"Loop finished\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the loop executes ten times as expected and exits successfully.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advanced Challenge  \n",
    "Hereâ€™s a challenge for you! Consider a scenario where you calculate an **average score** from a series of numbers using Go.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Code:  \n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "scores := []int{90, 85, 87, 92, 88}\n",
    "total := 0\n",
    "for i := 1; i < len(scores); i++ {  \n",
    "    total += scores[i]\n",
    "}\n",
    "average := float64(total) / float64(len(scores))\n",
    "fmt.Printf(\"The average score is %.1f\\n\", average)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you identify the logical error?  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Answer:**  \n",
    "The issue lies in the loop's iteration over the slice. The iteration starts at **index 1** instead of **index 0**, which means the first score (90 in this example) is not included in the calculation of the total.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lesson Summary  \n",
