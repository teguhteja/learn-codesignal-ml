    "Welcome to this thrilling session on **runtime errors** in Go programming! In this lesson, we will explore runtime errors, understand their types and occurrences, and learn how to handle them. By mastering these concepts, you will make your Go code more **reliable** and **fail-safe**.\n",

    "## **Understanding Runtime Errors**\n",
    "Runtime errors occur **during program execution** and prevent it from running as expected. These errors arise when commands, though syntactically correct, are logically impossible to execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Array Index Out of Range  \n",
    "The following code demonstrates an **index out of range** error:\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "package main\n",
    "\n",
    "import \"fmt\"\n",
    "\n",
    "func main() {\n",
    "    array := [5]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n",
    "\n",
    "    fmt.Println(array[5])  // Error: invalid argument: index 5 out of bounds [0:5]\n",

    "#### Error Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "invalid argument: index 5 out of bounds [0:5]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The error indicates that the program is trying to access an element **outside the declared limit** of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Types of Runtime Errors in Go**\n",
    "Common types of runtime errors include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Nil Pointer Dereferences:** Attempting to access a nil object’s property.\n",
    "2. **Index Out of Range:** Accessing elements outside the bounds of an array or slice.\n",
    "3. **Division by Zero:** Attempting to divide a number by zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Go uses a **panic mechanism** to handle such runtime errors. Let's look at examples of these errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nil Pointer Dereference\n",
    "```go\n",
    "package main\n",
    "\n",
    "import \"fmt\"\n",

    "---\n",

    "## **Identifying Runtime Errors**\n",
    "Go generates **specific error messages** for runtime issues. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Division by Zero\n",

    "package main\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Fixing Runtime Errors**\n",
    "The best way to handle runtime errors is to prevent error conditions programmatically. Here's an example of fixing a **division by zero** error:\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "package main\n",
    "\n",
    "import \"fmt\"\n",
    "\n",
    "func main() {\n",
    "    number := 10\n",
    "    zero := 0\n",

    "        fmt.Println(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "1. **Condition Check:** The program checks if the divisor is not zero.\n",
    "2. **Prevention:** If the divisor is zero, it prints a message instead of executing the division.\n",
    "3. **Result:** Prevents runtime errors and makes the program more robust.\n",

The given code showcases a simple yet effective way to handle potential runtime errors by checking the divisor before executing the division. This approach ensures your program runs smoothly without encountering a panic. Click Run to see how it elegantly handles both a safe division and an unsafe division by zero scenario!\n",

    "\n",
    "func main() {\n",
    "    dividend1 := 10\n",
    "    divisor1 := 2\n",
    "    if divisor1 == 0 {\n",
    "        fmt.Println(\"Oops! Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n",

    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided code effectively prevents runtime errors caused by a division by zero. It does this by **checking the divisor before performing the division**, ensuring the program doesn't panic and continues to run smoothly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features of the Code:\n",
    "1. **Condition Check:** Before dividing, the code checks if the divisor is zero.\n",
    "2. **Safe Execution:** \n",
    "   - If the divisor is zero, the program prints an error message: `\"Oops! Division by zero is not allowed.\"`\n",
    "   - Otherwise, it performs the division and prints the result.\n",
    "3. **Elegant Handling:** Demonstrates two scenarios:\n",
    "   - A safe division (10 ÷ 2).\n",
    "   - An unsafe division by zero (5 ÷ 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Output\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Result of division is 5\n",
    "Oops! Division by zero is not allowed.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "- **First Division:**\n",
    "  - `dividend1 = 10`, `divisor1 = 2`.\n",
    "  - Since `divisor1` is not zero, the division is executed, and the result `5` is printed.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Second Division:**\n",
    "  - `dividend2 = 5`, `divisor2 = 0`.\n",
    "  - Since `divisor2` is zero, the error message is displayed instead of attempting the division.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Approach Works\n",
    "This approach is simple and **fail-safe**, ensuring:\n",
    "1. **Avoidance of Runtime Errors:** Prevents Go's `panic` from being triggered by division by zero.\n",
    "2. **User-Friendly Output:** Communicates the issue to the user in plain language.\n",
    "3. **Program Continuity:** Ensures the program continues running even after encountering an unsafe scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Enhance Further:\n",
    "For large programs, you can encapsulate this logic in a function for reusability:\n",
    "```go\n",
    "package main\n",
    "\n",
    "import \"fmt\"\n",
    "\n",
    "func safeDivide(dividend, divisor int) {\n",
    "    if divisor == 0 {\n",
    "        fmt.Println(\"Oops! Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n",
    "    } else {\n",
    "        fmt.Println(\"Result of division is\", dividend/divisor)\n",

    "    safeDivide(5, 0)\n",
