    "# Understanding Go's Error Messages\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction  \n",
    "Hello! Today's expedition is about understanding **Go's error messages**. We'll examine how these error messages work, their structure, and the most common types that we're likely to encounter. Let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## An Overview of Go Error Messages  \n",
    "Go handles errors in a way that's somewhat different from other languages. In Go:  \n",
    "- An **error** is a predefined interface, not meant to signal an exception but to serve as a standard return type.  \n",
    "- When your Go code encounters a situation it canâ€™t handle, it typically **returns an error** to the caller of the function.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Structure of Go Error Messages  \n",
    "Go's error messages comprise the following:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Description**: A string that describes what went wrong.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Example  \n",
    "#### Code:  \n",
    "```go\n",
    "fmt.Println(\"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "```  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Error:  \n",
    "```\n",
    "syntax error: unexpected newline in argument list; possibly missing comma or )\n",
    "```  \n",
    "\n",
    "Although the error message might seem brief, it is direct. It indicates thereâ€™s a **missing parenthesis**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Error Breakdown:  \n",
    "- **Description**: `syntax error: unexpected newline in argument list; possibly missing comma or )`\n",
    "\n",
    "Every error message contains a description to help you identify what went wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploring Go Error Types  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Syntax Errors**  \n",
    "Syntax errors occur when the code violates Go's language rules, preventing compilation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Missing Brackets**:  \n",
    "  ```go\n",
    "  fmt.Println(\"Hello, Go!\"\n",
    "  ```  \n",
    "  **Error**:  \n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  syntax error: unexpected newline in argument list; possibly missing comma or )\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Misplaced Keywords**:  \n",
    "  ```go\n",
    "  func := 5 // Incorrect use of \"func\" as a variable name\n",
    "  ```  \n",
    "  **Error**:  \n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  syntax error: unexpected :=, expected (\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Logical Errors**  \n",
    "Logical errors occur when the code runs but doesnâ€™t produce the intended result. These are harder to detect since they are not flagged by the compiler.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Incorrect Loop Condition**:  \n",
    "  ```go\n",
    "  for i := 0; i < 10; i-- {\n",
    "      fmt.Println(i)\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```  \n",
    "  **Issue**: The loop runs infinitely because `i` decreases instead of increases.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Wrong Variable Used**:  \n",
    "  ```go\n",
    "  total := 10\n",
    "  count := 2\n",
    "  average := total / count\n",
    "  fmt.Println(\"Average:\", total) // Wrong variable used here\n",
    "  ```  \n",
    "  **Issue**: Prints the total instead of the average.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Runtime Errors**  \n",
    "Runtime errors occur during the execution of a program, after it has successfully compiled. These errors are typically more challenging to debug.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Concept: Panic  \n",
    "- In Go, a **panic** occurs when the program encounters an unrecoverable error (e.g., accessing an out-of-range index or dereferencing a nil pointer).  \n",
    "- Panics abruptly stop the program, unwinding the stack and running any deferred functions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Index Out of Range**:  \n",
    "  ```go\n",
    "  numbers := []int{1, 2, 3}\n",
    "  fmt.Println(numbers[4]) // Index out of range\n",
    "  ```  \n",
    "  **Error**:  \n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  panic: runtime error: index out of range [4] with length 3\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Nil Pointer Dereference**:  \n",
    "  ```go\n",
    "  var ptr *int // Declaring a nil pointer of type int\n",
    "  fmt.Println(*ptr) // This will cause a runtime panic\n",
    "  ```  \n",
    "  **Error**:  \n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lesson Summary  \n",
    "Congratulations! In this lesson, we've explored **Go's error messages** by categorizing them into:  \n",
    "1. **Syntax Errors**  \n",
    "2. **Logical Errors**  \n",
    "3. **Runtime Errors**  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways:  \n",
    "- Go's error messages provide concise descriptions to help debug effectively.  \n",
    "- Identifying the type of error (syntax, logical, or runtime) is crucial to resolving issues quickly.  \n",

    "### Explanation of Fix:\n",
    "1. **Syntax Error in Slice Declaration**:\n",
    "   - Original: `ingredients := []string{\"eggs\", \"milk\", \"sugar\", \"butter\"`\n",
    "   - Fixed: Added the missing closing brace `}` to properly terminate the slice definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **No Additional Changes**:\n",
    "   - The `len` function is used correctly to count the number of elements in the `ingredients` slice.\n",

    "1. **Corrected `totalCost` Type**:\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Formatted Output**:\n",
    "   - Replaced `+` string concatenation (not allowed with numeric types in Go) with `fmt.Printf` and a format specifier `%.2f` for floating-point numbers.\n",
