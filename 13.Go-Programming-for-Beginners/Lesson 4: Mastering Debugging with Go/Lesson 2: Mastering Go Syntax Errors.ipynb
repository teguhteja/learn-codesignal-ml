    "# Lesson 2: Mastering Go Syntax Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "# Introduction & Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to a new session! We're going to delve into **Syntax Errors in Go**. These mistakes can occur in the structure of our program. By the end of this lesson, you will have progressed toward writing flawless Go code.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining Syntax Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax can be likened to the guiding rules for the structure of a Go program. Much like grammatical rules in a language, Go also has certain protocols. When we don't adhere to these rules accurately, we're likely to encounter syntax errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples of Common Syntax Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Neglecting parentheses while calling a function**:\n",
    "```go\n",
    "fmt.Println \"Oops, it's a syntax error.\"  // Missed the parentheses\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Misplacing braces**:\n",
    "```go\n",
    "if true\n",
    "{  // Braces need to be on the same line as the 'if' statement\n",
    "    fmt.Println(\"Oops, it's a syntax error.\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Leaving parentheses or brackets unclosed**:\n",
    "```go\n",
    "fmt.Println(\"Oops, it's a syntax error.\"  // Missed the closing parenthesis\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Misusing Go keywords**:  \n",
    "A keyword in Go is a reserved word with a special meaning and purpose (e.g., `func`, `package`, `import`, `type`, etc.).\n",
    "```go\n",
    "if := 7  // 'if' is a keyword, not a variable\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Identifying Syntax Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Error messages serve as our guide in the bug-fixing process. These messages help identify **where**, **what**, and **why** an error occurred. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "./main.go:3:1: syntax error: non-declaration statement outside function body\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The message describes what went wrong and highlights the specific line where the error was found:\n",
    "- **`./main.go`**: The file where the error occurred.\n",
    "- **`3:1`**: The error is on the 3rd line and starts at the 1st character.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fixing Syntax Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of error-solving involves:\n",
    "1. **Reading the error message.**\n",
    "2. **Isolating the problematic portion of code.**\n",
    "3. **Reviewing the syntax rules.**\n",
    "4. **Leveraging online resources, if required.**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lesson Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Great job learning about syntax errors and how to identify and correct them! These skills are crucial in the programming journey: perpetual debugging, fixing, and learning. Keep an eye out for practice exercises designed to revise and strengthen these concepts. Practicing will hone your problem-solving skills and bolster your confidence in Go programming.\n",

    "## Syntax Sleuth in Go\n",
    "\n",
    "You've crafted a message to share with the digital realm using Go! But alas, there's a snag: a sneaky syntax error has found its way into your Go program. Please seek out and correct this error so that your message is broadcasted loud and clear to the world!\n",

    "\n",
    "func main() {\n",
    "    fmt.Println(\"Debugging is fun!\" \"\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "The issue in your Go program is an extra double quote (`\"\"`) at the end of the string inside the `fmt.Println` function. This causes a syntax error because the string is improperly closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hereâ€™s the corrected code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "package main\n",
    "\n",
    "import \"fmt\"\n",
    "\n",
    "func main() {\n",
    "    fmt.Println(\"Debugging is fun!\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "Your message to the universe is ready! However, it looks like there's a tiny syntactic mishap preventing it from being dispatched. Can you spot and rectify it? Remember, the error messages from the Go compiler are your navigational beacons in this cosmic quest!\n",

    "    fmt.Println(messageForUniverse[2])\n",

    "### Fixes:\n",
    "1. Added the missing closing double quote (`\"`) at the end of the third string:\n",
    "   ```go\n",
    "   \"We invite you to visit our small but beautiful planet.\",\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
