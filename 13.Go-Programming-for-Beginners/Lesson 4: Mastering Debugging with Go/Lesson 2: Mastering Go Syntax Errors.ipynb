    "# Lesson 2: Mastering Go Syntax Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "# Introduction & Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to a new session! We're going to delve into **Syntax Errors in Go**. These mistakes can occur in the structure of our program. By the end of this lesson, you will have progressed toward writing flawless Go code.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining Syntax Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax can be likened to the guiding rules for the structure of a Go program. Much like grammatical rules in a language, Go also has certain protocols. When we don't adhere to these rules accurately, we're likely to encounter syntax errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples of Common Syntax Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Neglecting parentheses while calling a function**:\n",
    "```go\n",
    "fmt.Println \"Oops, it's a syntax error.\"  // Missed the parentheses\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Misplacing braces**:\n",
    "```go\n",
    "if true\n",
    "{  // Braces need to be on the same line as the 'if' statement\n",
    "    fmt.Println(\"Oops, it's a syntax error.\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Leaving parentheses or brackets unclosed**:\n",
    "```go\n",
    "fmt.Println(\"Oops, it's a syntax error.\"  // Missed the closing parenthesis\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Misusing Go keywords**:  \n",
    "A keyword in Go is a reserved word with a special meaning and purpose (e.g., `func`, `package`, `import`, `type`, etc.).\n",
    "```go\n",
    "if := 7  // 'if' is a keyword, not a variable\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Identifying Syntax Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Error messages serve as our guide in the bug-fixing process. These messages help identify **where**, **what**, and **why** an error occurred. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "./main.go:3:1: syntax error: non-declaration statement outside function body\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The message describes what went wrong and highlights the specific line where the error was found:\n",
    "- **`./main.go`**: The file where the error occurred.\n",
    "- **`3:1`**: The error is on the 3rd line and starts at the 1st character.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fixing Syntax Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of error-solving involves:\n",
    "1. **Reading the error message.**\n",
    "2. **Isolating the problematic portion of code.**\n",
    "3. **Reviewing the syntax rules.**\n",
    "4. **Leveraging online resources, if required.**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lesson Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Great job learning about syntax errors and how to identify and correct them! These skills are crucial in the programming journey: perpetual debugging, fixing, and learning. Keep an eye out for practice exercises designed to revise and strengthen these concepts. Practicing will hone your problem-solving skills and bolster your confidence in Go programming.\n",

    "You've crafted a message to share with the digital realm using Go! But alas, there's a snag: a sneaky syntax error has found its way into your Go program. Please seek out and correct this error so that your message is broadcasted loud and clear to the world!\n",

    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "The issue in your Go program is an extra double quote (`\"\"`) at the end of the string inside the `fmt.Println` function. This causes a syntax error because the string is improperly closed.\n",

    "Hereâ€™s the corrected code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "package main\n",

    "    fmt.Println(\"Debugging is fun!\")\n",

    "    fmt.Println(messageForUniverse[2])\n",
    "}\n",

    "   ```go\n",
    "   \"We invite you to visit our small but beautiful planet.\",\n",
