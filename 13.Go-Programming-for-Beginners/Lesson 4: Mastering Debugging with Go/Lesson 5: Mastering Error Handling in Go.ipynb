    "### Code: Handling Nil Pointer for String in Go\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "package main\n",
    "\n",
    "import \"fmt\"\n",
    "\n",
    "func main() {\n",
    "    var text *string = nil\n",
    "\n",
    "    if text == nil {\n",
    "        fmt.Println(\"Text is nil and cannot be processed.\")\n",
    "    } else {\n",
    "        fmt.Println(\"Length of the text is:\", len(*text))\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "1. **Nil Pointer Check:**\n",
    "   - The condition `text == nil` checks if the string pointer `text` is nil (uninitialized).\n",
    "   - If true, the program prints a friendly message: `\"Text is nil and cannot be processed.\"`\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Safe Dereferencing:**\n",
    "   - If `text` is not nil, it is dereferenced with `*text`, and the length of the string it points to is calculated using the `len` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Assigning a Valid Value:**\n",
    "   - After assigning the string `\"Hello, Space Voyager!\"` to the pointer, the program safely processes the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Text is nil and cannot be processed.\n",
    "Length of the text is: 20\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of This Approach:\n",
    "- **Avoids Runtime Errors:** Prevents Go's `panic` caused by dereferencing nil pointers.\n",
    "- **Handles Strings Gracefully:** Ensures safe processing of string pointers.\n",
    "- **Clear Feedback:** Provides user-friendly error messages when the pointer is nil.\n",

    "We are on the brink of a major space expedition, and it's time to allocate the fuel to our fleet of rockets. Each rocket should receive an equal share of fuel. Unfortunately, due to an oversight, we attempted to distribute 100 fuel units to zero rockets. This has resulted in an error which ideally should never have occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Go, you cannot directly handle division by zero as an exception because Go design does not include exceptions like other languages. Check how we handle it here: simply validating the denominator!\n",

    "Execute the Go code provided to see how the error is managed and ensures our program doesn't crash!\n",

    "package main\n",

    "func main() {\n",
    "    fuel := 100\n",

    "The provided Go code handles the division by zero scenario gracefully by validating the denominator before performing the division. Here's a detailed walkthrough:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Explanation of the Code**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Breakdown:\n",
    "1. **Variable Initialization**:  \n",
    "   `fuel` is initialized to 100 units, and `rockets` is mistakenly set to 0.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Denominator Validation**:  \n",
    "   The code checks if the value of `rockets` is 0.  \n",
    "   - If `rockets == 0`, an error message is printed to prevent division by zero.  \n",
    "   - Otherwise, it calculates `fuelPerRocket` by dividing `fuel` by `rockets`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Output Results**:  \n",
    "   - If `rockets == 0`, the program outputs:  \n",
    "     `\"Oops! Number of rockets can't be zero!\"`  \n",
    "   - If `rockets > 0`, the program distributes the fuel evenly among the rockets and prints the amount each rocket receives.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Code**  \n",
    "```go\n",
    "package main\n",
    "\n",
    "import \"fmt\"\n",
    "\n",
    "func main() {\n",
    "    fuel := 100           // Total fuel available\n",
    "    rockets := 0          // Number of rockets (mistakenly set to 0)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    // Validate the denominator to prevent division by zero\n",
    "    if rockets == 0 {\n",
    "        fmt.Println(\"Oops! Number of rockets can't be zero!\")\n",
    "    } else {\n",
    "        fuelPerRocket := fuel / rockets\n",
    "        fmt.Printf(\"Each rocket can carry %d units of fuel\\n\", fuelPerRocket)\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Points**  \n",
    "1. **Error Prevention**:  \n",
    "   Go doesn't have exceptions like other languages, so errors like division by zero must be handled explicitly.  \n",
    "   - By adding a conditional check (`rockets == 0`), the program avoids runtime errors.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Program Stability**:  \n",
    "   Handling such edge cases ensures the program doesn't crash unexpectedly, keeping it stable and user-friendly.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Expected Output**  \n",
    "Since the number of rockets (`rockets`) is 0 in the current setup:  \n",
    "```\n",
    "Oops! Number of rockets can't be zero!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If `rockets` were set to a non-zero value, e.g., `rockets := 5`:  \n",
    "```\n",
    "Each rocket can carry 20 units of fuel\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion**  \n",
    "This code is a simple yet powerful example of how to handle errors like division by zero in Go. By validating inputs beforehand, we can avoid crashes and provide meaningful feedback to the user. Perfect for real-world scenarios like resource allocation in space expeditions! 🚀"
