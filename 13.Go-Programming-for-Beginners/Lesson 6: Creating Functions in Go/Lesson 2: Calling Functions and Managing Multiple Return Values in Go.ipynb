    "# Lesson 2: Calling Functions and Managing Multiple Return Values in Go\n",
    "\n",
    "# Topic Overview and Lesson Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "Greetings, Space Explorer! 🚀 Today, we’ll dive into the realm of **calling functions in Go**. By the end of this lesson, you will become proficient in:  \n",
    "- Function calls  \n",
    "- Transitive function calls  \n",
    "- Returning multiple values from functions  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🌟 Recall the Function Calling in Go\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as you use a remote to switch on your television, calling a function in Go executes a set of commands—like issuing instructions to your spaceship's computer. For example, here’s how we might welcome a new crew member:\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "package main\n",
    "import \"fmt\"\n",
    "\n",
    "func greet(name string) {\n",
    "    fmt.Printf(\"Hello %s, welcome aboard the spacecraft!\\n\", name)\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "func main() {\n",
    "    greet(\"Astro Kid\") // Prints: \"Hello Astro Kid, welcome aboard the spacecraft!\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we instruct the spacecraft’s computer to greet the newcomer, Astro Kid. Calling the `greet` function triggers the code block within that function.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛠️ Practical Explanation of Transitive Function Calling\n",
    "\n",
    "In interstellar parlance, **transitive function calling** is like delegating spaceship tasks. You can call one or multiple functions inside another, assigning responsibility. For instance, consider launching the spaceship:\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "package main\n",
    "import \"fmt\"\n",
    "\n",
    "func power_up_engine(level int) {\n",
    "    fmt.Printf(\"Powering up the engine to level %d\\n\", level)\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "func engine_start() {\n",
    "    fmt.Println(\"The engine has started!\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "func launch_spacecraft() {\n",
    "    fmt.Printf(\"Prepare for launch. \")\n",
    "    power_up_engine(3)\n",
    "    engine_start()\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "func main() {\n",
    "    launch_spacecraft()\n",
    "    /*\n",
    "        Prints:\n",
    "        Prepare for launch. Powering up the engine to level 3\n",
    "        The engine has started!\n",
    "    */\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `launch_spacecraft` calls:\n",
    "1. `power_up_engine(3)` to power up the engine, and\n",
    "2. `engine_start()` to handle post-startup operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach simplifies tasks by delegating them to specific functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔄 Understanding Functions with Multiple Return Values in Go\n",
    "\n",
    "Go allows a function to return **multiple results**—like monitoring fuel status and oxygen levels before takeoff. Here’s an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "package main\n",
    "import \"fmt\"\n",
    "\n",
    "func spaceship_status() (string, string) {\n",
    "    return \"Fuel: Full\", \"Oxygen: Normal\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "func main() {\n",
    "    fuel_status, oxygen_status := spaceship_status()\n",
    "\n",
    "    fmt.Println(fuel_status) // Prints: \"Fuel: Full\"\n",
    "    fmt.Println(oxygen_status) // Prints: \"Oxygen: Normal\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, `spaceship_status` performs:  \n",
    "1. A **fuel check**, and  \n",
    "2. An **oxygen check**,  \n",
    "returning both results. Note the `(string, string)` syntax to specify two return types.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "This Go code demonstrates how a function can return multiple values and shows a practical application by simulating a mission initialization for Apollo 11. Here's a detailed breakdown of the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Code Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Function Definition**\n",
    "```go\n",
    "func initializeSpacecraft(missionName string, startDate string, commandCenter string) (string, string, string) {\n",
    "    return missionName + \" initiated\", \"Mission start date: \" + startDate, \"Command Center: \" + commandCenter\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Input Parameters**:\n",
    "  - `missionName`: The name of the mission (e.g., \"Apollo 11\").\n",
    "  - `startDate`: The mission's launch date.\n",
    "  - `commandCenter`: The center overseeing the mission.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Return Values**:\n",
    "  - A message indicating mission initiation.\n",
    "  - A message specifying the mission start date.\n",
    "  - A message detailing the command center.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Main Function**\n",
    "```go\n",
    "func main() {\n",
    "    missionName, startDate, commandCenter := initializeSpacecraft(\"Apollo 11\", \"16th July 1969\", \"Kennedy Space Center\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    fmt.Println(missionName)    // Prints: \"Apollo 11 initiated\"\n",

    "    fmt.Println(commandCenter)  // Prints: \"Command Center: Kennedy Space Center\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. **Calling `initializeSpacecraft`**:\n",
    "   - The function is called with the Apollo 11 mission details.\n",
    "   - The returned values are assigned to variables `missionName`, `startDate`, and `commandCenter`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Output**:\n",
    "   - Each variable is printed using `fmt.Println`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🛠️ How It Works\n",
    "1. The `initializeSpacecraft` function combines input strings with additional text to create descriptive messages.\n",
    "2. It uses Go's ability to return multiple values in a single call, enabling efficient data retrieval.\n",
    "3. The returned values are unpacked into separate variables, making them easy to manipulate or print individually.\n",
