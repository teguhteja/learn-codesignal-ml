    "# Lesson 1: Exploring Functions in Go\n",
    "\n",
    "# Introduction\n",
    "Greetings, seeker of knowledge! Today, we're embarking on a journey to navigate the world of Go. We will focus particularly on **Go functions** â€” one of the key components in the programming universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as a recipe guides you through blending ingredients to create a delightful dish, functions in programming accept specific inputs (arguments), process them, and generate an output. For instance, consider a function in a meal-prep app. You input what ingredients you have, the app processes the input, and instantly, you receive a list of recipes you can cook. A striking illustration, isn't it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Are you ready to start creating your own Go functions? Letâ€™s dive in!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning to Write Go Functions\n",
    "### Structure of a Function\n",
    "Creating a Go function is straightforward. It involves several key components:\n",
    "- The `func` keyword\n",
    "- The function's name\n",
    "- Parentheses `()` for arguments\n",
    "- Return types\n",
    "- Curly brackets `{}` for the function body\n",
    "\n",
    "Hereâ€™s an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "func helloWorld() {\n",
    "    fmt.Println(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- **`helloWorld`** is the name of the function.\n",
    "- The function performs an operation enclosed within curly brackets `{}` â€” printing `\"Hello, World!\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can invoke (call) the function using its name followed by parentheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "func helloWorld() {\n",
    "    fmt.Println(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Call the function\n",
    "helloWorld() // Prints: \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run the code above, it prints `\"Hello, World!\"` on your screen. Congratulations! You've just coded your very first Go function.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Empty Function Body in Go\n",
    "Unlike Python, Go doesnâ€™t have a `pass` operator to define empty functions. Instead, you can use a `TODO` comment to signal a function is not yet implemented:\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "func notImplementedFunction() {\n",
    "    // TODO: Implement this.\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you call this function, it wonâ€™t do anything since its body is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functions with Arguments\n",
    "Just as recipes vary based on the ingredients used, Go functions become versatile when we introduce **arguments**. These inputs allow functions to produce varied results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hereâ€™s an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "func greet(message string) {\n",
    "    fmt.Println(message)\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Call the function with \"Good Morning!\"\n",
    "greet(\"Good Morning!\") // Prints: \"Good Morning!\"\n",
    "// Call the function with \"Good Evening!\"\n",
    "greet(\"Good Evening!\") // Prints: \"Good Evening!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above:\n",
    "- The `greet` function accepts a single argument `message` of type `string`.\n",
    "- When called, the function prints the provided argument, allowing us to reuse the code snippet with different inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functions that Give Back: Return Values\n",
    "Just as recipes yield a dish, functions can **return outputs**. To do this:\n",
    "1. Use the `return` keyword.\n",
    "2. Specify the type of the returned value before the opening curly bracket.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "func addNumbers(num1 int, num2 int) int {\n",
    "    result := num1 + num2\n",
    "    return result\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Call the function\n",
    "sum := addNumbers(3, 7)\n",
    "fmt.Println(sum)  // Prints: 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s happening:\n",
    "- The `addNumbers` function accepts two arguments (`num1` and `num2`), both of type `int`.\n",
    "- It calculates their sum, then returns it using the `return` keyword.\n",
    "- The returned value is assigned to the variable `sum` and displayed with `fmt.Println`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concluding Our Journey\n",
    "Congratulations! You've journeyed through the Go universe, exploring the magic of functions. Here's what we've achieved:\n",
    "1. **Created Go functions** to perform basic tasks.\n",
    "2. **Used arguments** to make functions dynamic.\n",
    "3. **Returned values** from functions for flexible results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now itâ€™s time to practice your newfound knowledge. Up next, we have exciting experiments and exercises designed to strengthen your command over Go functions. Letâ€™s get coding, and may your creativity shine as brightly as a cosmic star!\n",

    "1. **Added `taxRate` Parameter**:\n",
    "   - The `calculateOrderPrice` function now accepts an additional `taxRate` parameter of type `float64`.\n",

    "3. **Updated Function Call**:\n",

    "     ```\n",

    "### Benefits of the Update:\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: The tax rate can now be adjusted without modifying the function code.\n",
    "- **Reusability**: The function works for any tax rate, making it reusable across different scenarios.\n",
    "- **Scalability**: This setup can handle varied tax policies seamlessly, such as regional tax differences.\n",
