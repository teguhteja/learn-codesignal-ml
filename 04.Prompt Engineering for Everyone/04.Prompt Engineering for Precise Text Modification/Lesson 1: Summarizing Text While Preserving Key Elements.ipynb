    "## Introduction\n",
    "Welcome to this lesson in our comprehensive course on prompt engineering for precise text modification. This lesson focuses on the efficient summarization of text, ensuring that crucial elements, such as the tone, specific facts, or stylistic nuances, are preserved. Understanding how to maintain these elements can significantly enhance the relevance and utility of the summaries generated by Large Language Models (LLMs).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding What to Maintain in Summaries\n",
    "Before creating effective prompts for summaries, it's crucial to clearly define what \"X\" (the element(s) to maintain) is within your context. \"X\" could be the author's original tone, a thematic concern, a particular viewpoint, or even stylistic elements unique to the source material. Maintaining this element during summarization requires a deliberate prompt design strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider this elementary example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Markdown\n",
    "__ASK__\n",
    "Summarize the provided text, maintaining the original tone.\n",
    "\n",
    "__CONTEXT__\n",
    "- The text is a passionate environmental appeal.\n",
    "\n",
    "__CONSTRAINTS__\n",
    "- The summary should capture the urgency and emotional appeal of the original text.\n",
    "- Keep it under 100 words.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Maintaining Tone\n",
    "Crafting a prompt that instructs the LLM to maintain certain elements while summarizing involves being clear and specific about what needs to be preserved. Let's see an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Markdown\n",
    "\n",
    "__ASK__\n",
    "Provide a concise summary of the article.\n",
    "\n",
    "__CONTEXT__\n",
    "- The article is a thought-provoking opinion piece on climate change.\n",
    "\n",
    "__CONSTRAINTS__\n",
    "- Preserve the persuasive and urgent tone of the original article.\n",
    "- The summary should be no longer than 50 words.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the prompt clearly declares that, despite summarizing the content, the urgent and persuasive tone central to the initial article's impact should remain untouched.\n",
    "\n",
    "Preserving Specific Facts\n",
    "```Markdown\n",
    "\n",
    "__ASK__\n",
    "Summarize the research findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "__CONTEXT__\n",
    "- The document contains detailed findings on renewable energy efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "__CONSTRAINTS__\n",
    "- Include key statistics and data points in the summary.\n",
    "- Limit the summary to 150 words.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This sample instructs the model to distill the essence of the research findings while ensuring that critical statistics and data points are included, thus maintaining the validity of the factual content.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strategies for Efficient Summarization\n",
    "Effective summarization that maintains \"X\" relies on several strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Be explicit about what needs to be preserved. If it's the author's tone, specify whether it's humorous, serious, formal, etc.\n",
    "- Set clear boundaries regarding length and focus to ensure the summary stays on point.\n",
    "- Use examples to demonstrate the desired outcome, especially when trying to preserve less tangible elements like tone or style.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Learning to summarize text while maintaining specific elements is a nuanced skill in prompt engineering. It requires not only an understanding of the content to be summarized but also a deep appreciation for the elements contributing to its uniqueness. By following the principles outlined in this lesson and practicing with various texts and desired outcomes, you will refine your ability to harness the power of LLMs for precise and meaningful text modification, bridging the gap between brevity and substance."

    "## Simple summary\n",
    "Write a simple prompt that will summarize this article about Albert Einstein while maintaining the tone of the original text.\n",
    "\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "__ASK__\n",
    "Summarize the following article about Albert Einstein, maintaining the original tone.\n",
    "\n",
    "__CONTEXT__\n",
    "Albert Einstein, a theoretical physicist, is best known for his theory of relativity and the equation E=mc^2, which states that energy (E) equals mass (m) times the speed of light (c) squared. This groundbreaking work has had a profound impact on the development of modern physics and our understanding of the universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1905, Einstein published four papers in the Annalen der Physik scientific journal, which collectively are known as the Annus Mirabilis papers. Among these, was the paper on the Special Theory of Relativity, which introduced a new framework for all of physics and proposed new concepts of space and time. He argued that the laws of physics are the same for all non-accelerating observers, and he showed that the speed of light within a vacuum is the same no matter the speed at which an observer travels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Einstein's theory dramatically changed the way we understand the behavior of objects in motion and the flow of time across the universe. It introduced the concept that time and space are intertwined into a single continuum known as space-time. Events that occur at the same time for one observer could occur at different times for another.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1915, Einstein expanded on his Special Theory of Relativity by introducing the General Theory of Relativity. This theory proposed that gravity is not a force as it appears in Isaac Newton's law of universal gravitation, but rather is a consequence of the curvature of space-time caused by the uneven distribution of mass. The more massive an object, the more it warps the space around it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The General Theory of Relativity has been confirmed by numerous experiments and has provided a comprehensive framework for understanding cosmological phenomena, including black holes and the expansion of the universe. Einstein's theories of relativity remain central to modern physics and astronomy, influencing the development of technologies such as GPS navigation and advancing our understanding of the universe at its most fundamental level.\n",
    "\n",
