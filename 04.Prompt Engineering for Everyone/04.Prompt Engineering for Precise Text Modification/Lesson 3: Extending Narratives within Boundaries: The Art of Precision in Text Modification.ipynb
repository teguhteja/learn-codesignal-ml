    "## Introduction\n",
    "Welcome to the next lesson in our course on Prompt Engineering for Precise Text Modification. This lesson focuses on a critical skill in text manipulation using Large Language Models (LLMs). Extending or elaborating on a given text without altering specific predefined elements is particularly valuable when you need to preserve the essence of the original text — be it its setting, main characters, mood, or any other element — while adding more content to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding the Challenge\n",
    "The main challenge in extending a text without changing certain aspects lies in maintaining a delicate balance. You must enrich the narrative, explanatory text, or any other written content while ensuring that the additions feel seamless and natural and do not stray away from the original constraints. Achieving this requires a deep understanding of both the content you are working with and the constraints to which you need to adhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the task of extending a short story where the mood, setting, and characters are fixed. Here, your creativity must operate within these boundaries, expanding the story in a way that remains consistent and coherent with the initial setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Extending a Fantasy Scene\n",
    "To illustrate, let's look at an example prompt that's beautifully formatted using Markdown Prompt Framework (MPF):\n",
    "\n",
    "```Markdown\n",
    "\n",
    "__ASK__\n",
    "Reprint and extend the provided text without altering certain specified elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "__CONSTRAINTS__\n",
    "- Do not change the following elements:\n",
    "  1. The setting (the ancient bridge).\n",
    "  2. The main characters (the hero and the shadowy figure).\n",
    "  3. The mood (tense and ominous).\n",
    "- Extend the story by adding 100-150 words.\n",
    "- The extension should introduce a sudden twist in the ongoing confrontation.\n",
    "- Maintain the original tone and style of the writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "__CONTEXT__\n",
    "- The text is a short snippet from a fantasy novel.\n",
    "- It describes a scene where the hero, upon a mysterious, ancient bridge, faces off against a shadowy figure.\n",
    "____\n",
    "Given Text:  \n",
    "In the heart of the mist-covered bridge, stood the hero, his sword drawn, reflecting the pale moonlight. Across from him, a shadowy figure emerged, its intentions as obscure as its form. The air was heavy with anticipation of the impending duel.\n",
    "----\n",
    "```\n",
    "Sample output:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the heart of the mist-covered bridge, stood the hero, his sword drawn, reflecting the pale moonlight. Across from him, a shadowy figure emerged, its intentions as obscure as its form. The air was heavy with anticipation of the impending duel. The bridge, a silent witness to countless battles, seemed to hold its breath for yet another confrontation. The hero, with determination in his eyes, readied himself, knowing the shadowy adversary was unlike any he had faced before. Just as the hero braced for an attack, the ground beneath them trembled, and the ancient stones of the bridge began to glow with an ethereal light.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unexpectedly, the shadowy figure halted, its form becoming less opaque, revealing a visage tormented by sorrow rather than malice. \"I am no enemy,\" the figure spoke, its voice echoing with a haunting melody that seemed to resonate with the very essence of the bridge. \"The real foe lies beyond, seeking to destroy what I've sworn to protect.\" The hero, taken aback, lowered his weapon slightly, sensing the sincerity in the figure's words. The tension that once filled the air shifted, giving way to a fragile truce formed upon the realization that perhaps their fates were intertwined more closely than they had imagined. Together, they turned their attention to the darkness that lay beyond, where the true threat awaited, hidden in the shadows that stretched ominously across the ancient stones.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see how the `__CONSTRAINTS__` section clearly specifies what needs to be maintained while extending the story. And as you can see from the output, it works perfectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "The ability to extend a text without changing specific elements is a skill that intertwines creativity with restraint. Achieving this effectively can greatly enhance the depth and richness of a narrative or other written content. By understanding and applying the strategies outlined in this lesson, you'll be better equipped to face the challenges of precise text modification using LLMs. Remember, practice is key to mastering this skill, so continue experimenting with different texts and constraints to optimize your approach.\n",
