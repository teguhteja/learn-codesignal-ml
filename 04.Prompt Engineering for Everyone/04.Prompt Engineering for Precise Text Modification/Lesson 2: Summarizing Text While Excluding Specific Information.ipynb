    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome back! Today, we're tackling a nuanced but incredibly valuable skill: crafting prompts that guide Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate summaries absent specific elements. This technique is particularly useful when you need to remove sensitive information, spoilers, or irrelevant details from the text. Learning this technique will enhance your ability to customize outputs to fit precisely your needs while ensuring the unnecessary parts are excised.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding the Task\n",
    "Summarizing while excluding specific elements presents a unique challenge. It necessitates a keen understanding of the essential information and what qualifies as 'X' â€” the segment you want to omit. Developing this skill depends on clearly and precisely conveying your requirements to the model. You're essentially asking the model to comprehend the core message or story and then retell it, minus the parts you specify.\n",
    "\n",
    "When desiring to exclude specific elements from your summaries, you need to structure your prompts carefully. Here's a straightforward strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Markdown\n",
    "__ASK__\n",
    "Summarize the article provided, excluding any financial terms and data.\n",
    "\n",
    "__CONSTRAINTS__\n",
    "- Focus on the technological impacts and future implications.\n",
    "- Avoid mentioning any financial figures, terms, or investment details.\n",
    "\n",
    "__CONTEXT__\n",
    "- [TEXT OF THE ARTICLE]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Following this structure guarantees that the financial aspects are left out, allowing the summary to concentrate solely on the technological perspectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "More Complex Scenarios\n",
    "Let's look at a more complex scenario. Assume you're summarizing a news article on the recent launch of a new smartphone, but you want to omit all mentions of the company's controversies. How can you help the model better understand what you mean by a \"controversy\", though?\n",
    "\n",
    "```Markdown\n",
    "\n",
    "__ASK__\n",
    "Summarize the provided article.\n",
    "\n",
    "__CONSTRAINTS__\n",
    "- Focusing on the smartphone launch details.\n",
    "- Highlight key features, release date, and initial public reactions.\n",
    "- Leave out any unfavorable remarks or topics that don't paint the company in a positive light.\n",
    "- Do not include any information related to legal matters or controversies involving the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "__CONTEXT__\n",
    "- [TEXT OF THE ARTICLE]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see here under the __CONSTRAINTS__ section we guide the model with specific instructions on what to and not to include instead of leaving it to interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Learning to summarize text while intentionally omitting certain details expands your toolkit in prompt engineering. This lesson not only illustrated the importance of providing precise and clear instructions but also furnished a framework for approaching this nuanced task. Through sustained practice, you'll be able to generate summaries that perfectly align with your unique requirements, rendering your use of LLMs even more tailored and effective.\n",

    "\n",
    "Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple Inc., is celebrated for his extraordinary contributions to technology and design, significantly impacting the computer, entertainment, and mobile industries. Under his leadership, Apple introduced groundbreaking products like the Macintosh computer, iPod, iPhone, and iPad, which have set new standards for innovation, design, and functionality.

    "However, Steve Jobs's management style was also a source of controversy. Described as demanding and intensely critical, he could be challenging to work with, often pushing employees to their limits to achieve the perfection he envisioned. His approach led to numerous conflicts and was characterized by some as tyrannical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jobs's early reluctance to engage in philanthropic activities also drew criticism, contrasting with the practices of other high-profile billionaires. Though in his later years, he and his wife, Laurene Powell Jobs, made significant, albeit less publicized, charitable contributions.\n",

    "Moreover, Jobs's initial denial of paternity for his daughter Lisa Brennan-Jobs added a personal controversy. His relationship with her and her mother, Chrisann Brennan, was complicated and strained, though it evolved over time.\n",

    "Despite these controversies, Steve Jobs's legacy as a pioneer of modern technology is undisputed. His influence on technology and culture continues to be felt worldwide, and his story is a testament to the complex interplay between genius and the human elements of ambition, imperfection, and redemption.\n",
