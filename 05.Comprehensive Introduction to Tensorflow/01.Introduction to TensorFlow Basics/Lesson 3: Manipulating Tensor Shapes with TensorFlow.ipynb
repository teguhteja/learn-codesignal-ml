    "## Topic Overview\n",
    "Welcome to today's lesson on the shaping and reshaping of tensors using TensorFlow, a key toolkit in machine learning. This fundamental aspect underpins much of what makes machine learning models effective and versatile. The ability to manipulate the shapes of tensors - the core data structure in TensorFlow - plays a crucial role in aligning data to the specific needs of various models. By the end of this lesson, you will master the theory behind tensor reshaping and gain practical skills in adjusting tensor shapes using TensorFlow, enabling you to tackle more complex machine learning challenges with confidence.\n",

    "## Understanding Tensor Reshaping\n",
    "Tensors are multidimensional arrays and are a core data type in TensorFlow. They come in various shapes and sizes, representing the data that feeds into, circulates between, and outputs from layers in a neural network. However, sometimes, the shape of the data doesn't align with the demands of the model. For instance, a model might require a 3D tensor as an input, while the data we possess is stored in 2D matrices or 1D arrays. This is where tensor reshaping comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensor reshaping does not change the underlying data of the tensor; instead, it modifies how that data is arranged. Consider a tensor like a chunk of clay, and reshaping it is akin to modeling it into different forms â€” from a sphere to a cube, from a cuboid to a cylinder, and so on. It's the same clay, just presented in a different shape. Technically, tensor reshaping is the process of adding, removing, or rearranging the dimensions of a tensor as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tensor Shape Manipulation\n",
    "TensorFlow provides numerous functions for manipulating tensors, among which tf.reshape is a defining component. It fits into our clay modeling analogy perfectly; it's like a software tool that chisels the data block into the forms we want. And what's more, TensorFlow's approach is very efficient, often not even requiring the actual movement of data to reshape tensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dive into the depths of these functions utilizing the code snippet you've been provided:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "\n",
    "import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a tensor for manipulation\n",
    "tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Reshape the tensor\n",
    "reshaped_tensor = tf.reshape(tensor, [3, 2])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Flatten the tensor\n",
    "flattened_tensor = tf.reshape(tensor, [-1])\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"Original Tensor:\\n {tensor} \\n\")\n",
    "print(f\"Reshaped Tensor:\\n {reshaped_tensor} \\n\")\n",
    "print(f\"Flattened Tensor:\\n {flattened_tensor}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code, we first import the TensorFlow library. Following this, a 2D tensor is created using tf.constant. This tensor is then reshaped into a 3x2 tensor using tf.reshape. Lastly, the same tensor is flattened into a 1D array. When '-1' is used alone, it counts the total number of elements and reshapes the tensor into a 1D array with that size, e.g., (size,). This makes reshaping more flexible and easier to manage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "Copy\n",
    "Original Tensor:\n",
    "[[1 2 3]\n",
    " [4 5 6]]\n",
    "\n",
    "Reshaped Tensor:\n",
    "[[1 2]\n",
    " [3 4]\n",
    " [5 6]]\n",
    "\n",
    "Flattened Tensor:\n",
    "[1 2 3 4 5 6]\n",
    "```\n",
    "This output demonstrates the flexibility of TensorFlow in reshaping tensors. The original 2x3 tensor is first reshaped into a 3x2 tensor and then flattened into a 1D tensor, illustrating how shape manipulation does not alter the underlying data, only the view of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lesson Summary and Practice\n",
    "We've covered a lot of ground in this lesson, delving into the core concepts of tensor reshaping in TensorFlow, why it's essential, and how to perform it. The ability to reshape tensors increases your arsenal for handling data and building models in TensorFlow. It paves the way for a smoother journey through your machine learning adventures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you'll consolidate your understanding by getting hands-on with tensor reshaping in TensorFlow through a series of practice exercises. These tasks aim to allow you to directly apply what you've learned, reinforce your knowledge, and give you confidence in your abilities to manipulate tensor shapes. Let's dive in, and happy TensorFlow shaping!"
