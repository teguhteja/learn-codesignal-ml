    "# Lesson Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to today's lesson on addressing data leakage in time series data while preparing it for machine learning. In this lesson, you'll learn the importance of maintaining temporal order in your dataset splits to avoid forward-looking bias, which can misleadingly inflate your model's performance. We'll be using the Tesla ($TSLA) stock data as an example. By the end of this lesson, you'll understand how to partition your dataset correctly using `TimeSeriesSplit` from the `sklearn.model_selection` library.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Data Leakage in Time Series\n",
    "\n",
    "Data leakage occurs when information from outside the training dataset inadvertently makes its way into the model. This is particularly problematic in time series data, where the natural temporal ordering is crucial. Data leakage can lead to an overestimation of a model's performance because it allows information from the future to be used in making predictions about the past.\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with stock market data, using future prices to predict past prices would artificially inflate a model's accuracy and yield unreliable predictions for actual trading strategies. Hence, it's important to ensure that our training and testing sets are separated in a way that respects the temporal nature of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Revisiting Feature Engineering and Scaling (Revision)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's quickly revise how to engineer features and scale them. These steps are foundational for preparing your data for machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import datasets\n",
    "from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load the dataset\n",
    "data = datasets.load_dataset('codesignal/tsla-historic-prices')\n",
    "tesla_df = pd.DataFrame(data['train'])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Feature Engineering: creating new features\n",
    "tesla_df['High-Low'] = tesla_df['High'] - tesla_df['Low']\n",
    "tesla_df['Price-Open'] = tesla_df['Close'] - tesla_df['Open']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Defining features and target\n",
    "features = tesla_df[['High-Low', 'Price-Open', 'Volume']].values\n",
    "target = tesla_df['Close'].values\n",
    "\n",
    "# Scaling\n",
    "scaler = StandardScaler()\n",
    "features_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(features)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this snippet, we create two new features, `High-Low` and `Price-Open`, and scale these features using `StandardScaler`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Correctly Splitting Time Series Data\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid data leakage in time series, we need to split our data so that future data points are not used to predict past data points. `TimeSeriesSplit` from the `sklearn.model_selection` library helps achieve this.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `TimeSeriesSplit` class helps you create train/test splits that respect the temporal order of your data. One of the key arguments in `TimeSeriesSplit` is `n_splits`, which specifies the number of re-shuffling and splitting iterations. Essentially, this determines how many different train/test splits will be generated from your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.model_selection import TimeSeriesSplit\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initiate TimeSeriesSplit\n",
    "tscv = TimeSeriesSplit(n_splits=3)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Splitting with TimeSeriesSplit\n",
    "for fold, (train_index, test_index) in enumerate(tscv.split(features_scaled)):\n",
    "    print(f\"Fold {fold + 1}\")\n",
    "    print(f\"TRAIN indices (first 5): {train_index[:5]}, TEST indices (first 5): {test_index[:5]}\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Splitting the features and target\n",
    "    X_train, X_test = features_scaled[train_index], features_scaled[test_index]\n",
    "    y_train, y_test = target[train_index], target[test_index]\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Print a small sample of the data\n",
    "    print(f\"X_train sample:\\n {X_train[:2]}\")\n",
    "    print(f\"y_train sample:\\n {y_train[:2]}\")\n",
    "    print(f\"X_test sample:\\n {X_test[:2]}\")\n",
    "    print(f\"y_test sample:\\n {y_test[:2]}\")\n",
    "    print(\"-\" * 10)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To elaborate, `TimeSeriesSplit` generates indices for multiple train/test splits, where the training set for each split consists of all data points up to a specific point in time, and the test set includes the subsequent data points in time. This sequential process respects the chronological order of the data. As a result, no future data points are included in the training set of any fold, which effectively prevents data leakage. This method ensures that our model training and evaluation simulate real-world scenarios more accurately, thereby providing reliable performance metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analyzing Fold Results\n",

    "Let's analyze the output from each fold to ensure correct data splitting. The output of the above code will be:\n",

    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Loading the Dataset**: The Tesla stock dataset is loaded using the `datasets` library, and it's converted into a Pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Engineering**:\n",
    "   - `Moving_Average_10`: A 10-day simple moving average of the closing prices.\n",
    "   - `Returns`: The difference between the closing and opening prices for the day.\n",
    "   - We drop any NaN values generated due to the moving average calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Defining Features and Target**:\n",
    "   - The features are selected as `Moving_Average_10`, `Returns`, and `Volume`.\n",
    "   - The target is set as the `Close` price.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Scaling**:\n",
    "   - The features are scaled using `StandardScaler` to standardize the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **TimeSeriesSplit**:\n",
    "   - `TimeSeriesSplit` is used with 3 splits to ensure that the temporal order is maintained.\n",
    "   - For each fold, the code prints the first and last 5 indices of the training and test sets, along with samples from the scaled features and corresponding targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code ensures that the time series data is split without leakage and is correctly scaled for each fold. This process is crucial for building reliable models on time series data, especially in financial analysis."
