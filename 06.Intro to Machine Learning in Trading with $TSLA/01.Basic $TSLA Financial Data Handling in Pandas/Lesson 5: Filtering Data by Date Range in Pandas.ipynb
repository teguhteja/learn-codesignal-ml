    "# Introduction to Date Filtering\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll explore how to filter time series financial data by date range using the Pandas library. Filtering data by specific date ranges is vital in financial analysis, allowing us to focus on periods of interest, such as a particular year or month. This skill is essential for traders and analysts who need to examine stock performance during specific periods, such as economic crises or fiscal quarters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Converting Date Columns to Datetime Objects\n",
    "The first step in filtering data by date is to ensure that the date column is in a suitable format. Let's start by loading the Tesla ($TSLA) stock dataset and converting the \"Date\" column to datetime objects using pd.to_datetime().\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "Copy\n",
    "Play\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",

    "\n",
    "# Load TSLA dataset\n",
