    "## Introduction to Pandas and Financial Data Handling\n",
    "Hello and welcome! In today's lesson, you'll learn how to handle basic financial data using the Pandas library. Specifically, we'll focus on loading and displaying Tesla's ($TSLA) stock data. Understanding how to manipulate data using Pandas is an essential skill in data analysis and can significantly improve your machine-learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is a powerful Python library that provides data structures and data analysis tools. It's particularly useful for managing time series data, like stock prices, transaction records, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding how to use Pandas in the context of financial data is vital. It helps in pre-processing data, making trading decisions, and even predicting market trends. Let's dive into this by starting with how to load financial data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loading Data using the 'datasets' Library\n",
    "We'll start by loading the Tesla ($TSLA) dataset using the datasets library - a library that's already built in the CodeSignal IDE. This library simplifies the process of fetching well-known datasets, so you can focus on analyzing and manipulating the data rather than spending time gathering it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how you can load the TSLA dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "import datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load the TSLA dataset using the datasets library\n",
    "tesla_data = datasets.load_dataset('codesignal/tsla-historic-prices')\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this code, we import the datasets library and use its load_dataset function to fetch the Tesla stock prices. The argument 'codesignal/tsla-historic-prices' tells the datasets library exactly which dataset to load.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating a DataFrame in Pandas\n",
    "Once we have our data, the next step is to create a DataFrame using Pandas. A DataFrame is a two-dimensional, size-mutable, and heterogeneous tabular data structure with labeled axes (rows and columns). Think of it as an Excel spreadsheet or a SQL table but with much more functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how you can create a DataFrame using Pandas:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create DataFrame from the dataset\n",
    "tesla_df = pd.DataFrame(tesla_data['train'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this snippet, we import the Pandas library and create a DataFrame called tesla_df using the data we loaded previously. The tesla_data['train'] part extracts the training data from the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Displaying Data from a DataFrame: The Head\n",
    "Now that we have our DataFrame, it's crucial to know how to display its contents. Displaying data helps us understand its structure and the kind of information it holds.\n",
    "\n",
    "To display the first few rows of our DataFrame, we can use the head() method. This method is handy when you want to quickly check the beginning of your DataFrame:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "# Display the first few rows of the DataFrame\n",
    "print(tesla_df.head())\n",
    "```\n",
    "The output of the above code will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "         Date      Open      High       Low     Close  Adj Close     Volume\n",
    "0  2010-06-29  1.266667  1.666667  1.169333  1.592667   1.592667  281494500\n",
    "1  2010-06-30  1.719333  2.028000  1.553333  1.588667   1.588667  257806500\n",
    "2  2010-07-01  1.666667  1.728000  1.351333  1.464000   1.464000  123282000\n",

    "This output shows a truncated view of Tesla stock prices starting from its initial public offering (IPO). Each row represents a day with columns for the date, opening price, highest price of the day, lowest price of the day, closing price, adjusted closing price, and the volume of stocks traded.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Displaying Data from a DataFrame: The Tail\n",
    "You can also use the tail() method to view the last few rows of the DataFrame. This can be helpful in different scenarios, such as when checking the most recent stock prices:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "# Display the last few rows of the DataFrame\n",
    "print(tesla_df.tail())\n",
    "```\n",
    "The output of the above code will be:\n",
    "\n",

    "This output demonstrates the structure of the dataset showing recent trading days. It provides insights into the latest trends, including closing and opening prices, for Tesla stock. Such information is crucial for making informed investment decisions.\n",

    "The error in your code is related to how you're loading and processing the dataset using the `datasets` library. The `datasets.load_dataset` function returns a `DatasetDict` object, not a Pandas DataFrame, which is why you're getting an error when trying to convert it directly into a DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how you can fix the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load the dataset**: The `load_dataset` function returns a `DatasetDict`. You need to access the appropriate split of the dataset (e.g., 'train') to convert it into a DataFrame.\n",
    "2. **Convert to DataFrame**: Convert the correct part of the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s the corrected code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load the TSLA dataset using the datasets library\n",

    "print(tesla_df.head())\n",
    "\n",
    "# Display the last few rows of the DataFrame\n",
    "print(tesla_df.tail())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "- **Accessing the 'train' split**: The `load_dataset` function typically returns a dictionary where each key represents a different split (like 'train', 'test', etc.). You need to specify which split you want to use, in this case, `'train'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Converting to DataFrame**: Once you access the correct split, you can then convert it to a Pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation and display.\n",
    "\n",
