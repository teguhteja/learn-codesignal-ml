We will start with a glance at the structure of Decision Trees, understand the mechanics of splitting, and then dive into the application of the Gini Index, a measure of the quality of a split. Inspired by these insights, we will finish by creating a split function using Python and running it on a sample dataset. So, let's roll up our sleeves and dig into the world of Decision Trees!\n",

It starts at a single node, called the root, which splits into branches. Each branch, in turn, splits into more branches, forming a hierarchical network. The final branches with no further splits are referred to as leaf nodes. Each split is determined by whether the data satisfies a specific condition.\n",

The tree would then split into two branches - one for yes and another for no. Each branch could further split based on another attribute, such as cough present. This process of splitting continues until we conclude the leaf nodes, such as recovery probable or recovery doubtful. Isn't this a straightforward and intuitive way to make complex decisions?\n",

The goal of a Decision Tree in this context would be to split these socks into separate baskets (or groups) based on their colors.
