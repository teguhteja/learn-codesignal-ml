                                    "Welcome to our insightful journey into Stacking, a robust ensemble learning technique prevalent in machine learning. The primary objective of this lesson is to design and implement a basic Stacking model using a diverse set of classifiers in Python. Stacking is an ensemble learning method that combines a series of predictions from various models, known as base models, to build a new model called the meta-model. The performance enhancements in the dataset stem from the final prediction made by this meta-model. We will delve into understanding stacking, train base models, craft a meta-model, implement them in Python, and finally touch on evaluating and understanding the concept of accuracy in this context.\n",
