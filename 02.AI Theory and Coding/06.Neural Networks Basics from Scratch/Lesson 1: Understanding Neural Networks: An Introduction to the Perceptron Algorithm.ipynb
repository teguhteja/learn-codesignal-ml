This significant algorithm sparks your comprehension of advanced Neural Networks utilized in Machine Learning. The objectives of this lesson include mastering and coding a perceptron using Python from scratch. We will decipher the structure of a perceptron, the prediction method, and the training process. To conclude, we will design a fully functioning model that abstracts a simple logical scenario using the AND operator data.\n",
