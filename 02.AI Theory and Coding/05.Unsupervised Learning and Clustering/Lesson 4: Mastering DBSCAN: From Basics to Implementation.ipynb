Standing out in the clustering landscape, DBSCAN is famous for its resilience to outliers and for eliminating the need for pre-set cluster numbers. This lesson will demystify DBSCAN through a Python-based implementation from scratch.\n",

Concurrently, it classifies low-density entities as noise, enhancing its robustness towards outliers. The secret recipe behind DBSCAN? A pair of parameters: **Epsilon (Eps)** and **Minimum Points (MinPts)**, which guide the classification of points into categories of 'core', 'border', or 'outlier'.\n",
