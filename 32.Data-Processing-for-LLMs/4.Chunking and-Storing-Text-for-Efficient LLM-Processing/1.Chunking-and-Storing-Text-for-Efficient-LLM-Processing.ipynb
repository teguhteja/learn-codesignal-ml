By chunking text, we ensure that each piece is small enough to be processed efficiently by the model while retaining coherence and meaning.\n",

The lesson covers common chunking strategies, including fixed-length, sentence-based, and paragraph-based chunking, and provides Python implementations for each method. Fixed-length chunking is simple but may disrupt context, sentence-based chunking maintains sentence integrity, and paragraph-based chunking preserves paragraph structure. Each method has its pros and cons, depending on the use case and model requirements. Additionally, the lesson highlights how tokenization and chunking work together to optimize text for LLM processing."
