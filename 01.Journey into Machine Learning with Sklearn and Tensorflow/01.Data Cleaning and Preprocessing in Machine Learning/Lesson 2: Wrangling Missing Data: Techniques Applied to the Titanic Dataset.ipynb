    "As an analyst or data scientist, it's pivotal to understand why data might be missing, as it helps in choosing the best strategy to handle it. Missing data, which are like missing puzzle pieces, can occur due to several reasons, such as not being collected, being recorded incorrectly, or even being lost over time.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Missing completely at random (MCAR): The missing data entries are random and don't correlate with any other data.\n",
    "Missing at random (MAR): The missing values depend on the values of other variables.\n",
