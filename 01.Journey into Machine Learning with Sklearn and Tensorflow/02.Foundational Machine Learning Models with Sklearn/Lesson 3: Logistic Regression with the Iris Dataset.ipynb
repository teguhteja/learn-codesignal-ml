    "# Lesson 3: Logistic Regression with the Iris Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploring Linear Regression with Python and Sklearn\n",
    "Topic Overview\n",
    "In today's lesson, we are embarking on an exploration of the powerful statistical model known as Linear Regression. While venturing into the realms of machine learning, we will dissect the foundations of linear regression, implement it using the library sklearn, and apply it to the Iris dataset. We will then visualize these fascinating results using matplotlib. Keep your explorer spirit high, for by the end of this journey, you'll be well versed in understanding, implementing, and interpreting Linear Regression using Python and sklearn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Regression is a pillar of many machine learning algorithms, and hence, understanding it acts as a stepping stone towards grasping more complex statistical approaches. Get ready to turn the wheels of your mind and dive right in!\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduction to Linear Regression\n",
    "Linear Regression is a prime tool in a statistician's toolbox, intended to decipher the relationship between two or more variables. To break it down into simpler terms, imagine you are an explorer observing a sunrise. You realize that, the higher the sun rises in the sky, the brighter it gets. This scenario is a simple example of linear regression, where the height of the sun (an independent variable) and the brightness (a dependent variable) share a linear relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though it is a powerful tool, it does not conform to every scenario in real life, posing a limitation. Unlike brightness being a linear aspect of a sunrise, improvements in an athlete's performance do not strictly depend on training hours. Factors like nutrition, rest, and mindset also contribute substantially. Despite its limitations in some scenarios, Linear Regression, given its simplicity and efficiency, is widely used in areas like economics, computer science, and business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Regression in Sklearn\n",
    "Meet sklearn, a highly efficient Python library that provides robust tools for machine learning and modeling, including Linear Regression. The sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression class comes with a multitude of methods like fit() for training the model on data, predict() for making predictions, and many more. Let's apply it to the Iris dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will be taking the sepal length as an independent variable (X) and using it to predict the sepal width (the dependent variable, y). Here's how we can do it:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "Copy\n",
    "from sklearn.datasets import load_iris\n",
    "from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n",
    "\n",
    "# Loading the Iris dataset\n",
    "iris_data = load_iris()\n",
    "X = iris_data.data[:, :1]  # Sepal length\n",
    "y = iris_data.data[:, 1:2]  # Sepal width\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an instance of Linear Regression model\n",
    "lr_model = LinearRegression()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fitting the model to our data\n",
    "lr_model.fit(X, y)\n",
    "The fit() function trains our model on the data points X and y. From a bird's-eye view, the function tries to draw a line that represents all the points as accurately as possible. Voila! We have now trained a Linear Regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Work with Linear Regression's Results\n",
    "With our model trained, we can explore some of the attributes of the model, like the coefficients and the intercept, which are the building blocks of the equation \n",
    "y\n",
    "=\n",
    "m\n",
    "∗\n",
    "x\n",
    "+\n",
    "c\n",
    "y=m∗x+c. Here m is the slope (coefficients), c is the y-intercept, x is the independent variable (sepal length), and y is the dependent variable (predicted sepal width).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's find out the coefficients and intercept of our model:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "Copy\n",
    "# Printing coefficients and intercept\n",
    "print('Coefficient (Slope): ', lr_model.coef_)\n",
    "print('Intercept (Y-intercept): ', lr_model.intercept_)\n",
    "The output of the above code will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "Copy\n",
    "Coefficient (Slope): [[-0.22336106]]\n",
    "Intercept (Y-intercept): [3.41894684]\n",
    "Furthermore, we can utilize our trained model to predict the sepal width for new sepal length observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "Copy\n",
    "# Sample sepal lengths\n",
    "new_sepal_length_values = [[4.5], [5.5], [6.5]]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Printing the predicted sepal widths\n",
    "predicted_sepal_width_values = lr_model.predict(new_sepal_length_values)\n",
    "print('Predicted Sepal Width values: ', predicted_sepal_width_values)\n",
    "The output of the above code will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "Copy\n",
    "Predicted Sepal Width values: [[2.4171761 ]\n",
    "                               [2.189183  ]\n",
    "                               [1.9611899 ]]\n",
    "Now, the machine you've built can predict sepal width given its length. Exciting, isn't it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualizing Linear Regression Model\n",
    "Visual aids play an essential role in understanding and interpreting data. Python's Matplotlib library is a potent tool for brewing striking visuals, helping us derive meaningful insights from our data. With Matplotlib, we will plot our data and the regression line on a 2D graph, cultivating a richer understanding of our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "Copy\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "\n",
    "# Plotting actual data points\n",
    "plt.scatter(X, y, color='red') \n",
    "\n",
    "# Plotting the regression line\n",
    "plt.plot(X, lr_model.predict(X), color='blue')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Setting labels and title\n",
    "plt.xlabel('Sepal length')\n",
    "plt.ylabel('Sepal width')\n",
    "plt.title('Sepal length vs Sepal width (Linear Regression)')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Displaying our plot\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "After running the code above, we see a plot with a regression line going through the data points, providing a clearer understanding of the linear relationship between sepal length and sepal width.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how the formula for the linear regression line can be used to calculate the predicted sepal width: \n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "Copy\n",
    "sepal_width = 4.5 #x value\n",
    "m = lr_model.coef_\n",
    "b = lr_model.intercept_\n",
    "predicted_speal_length = m * sepal_width + b #y value\n",
    "print(predicted_sepal_length) # 2.4171761\n",
    "This formula predicts a sepal length of 2.4171761, just like the .predict method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lesson Summary and Practice\n",
    "A round of applause for you! Today, you've built your first Linear Regression model. You've touched upon and explored the nuts and bolts of Linear Regression with the support of sklearn. You applied the model to the Iris dataset, and the resulting graphs brought a moment of clarity and understanding to your learning path.\n",
