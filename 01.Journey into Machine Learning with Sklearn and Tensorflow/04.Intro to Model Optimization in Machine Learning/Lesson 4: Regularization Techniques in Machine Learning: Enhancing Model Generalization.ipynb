Overfitting is like memorizing the answers to a test rather than understanding the subject. It happens when a model learns the training data too well, including its noise and outliers, which hampers its performance on new, unseen data. Regularization helps to prevent this by simplifying the model in a controlled way.\n",

This can lead to a model that's easier to interpret and less prone to overfitting. In technical terms, L1 adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients.\n",

This method is useful when many features contribute small effects, and you don't want to eliminate them entirely. L2 adds a penalty equal to the square of the magnitude of coefficients.\n",
