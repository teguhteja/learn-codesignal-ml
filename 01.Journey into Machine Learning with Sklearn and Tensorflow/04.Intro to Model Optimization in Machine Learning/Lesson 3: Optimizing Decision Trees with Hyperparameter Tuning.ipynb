Our prime focus is explaining and applying hyperparameter tuning to decision trees. Decision trees are a critical class of machine learning algorithms frequently used for classification and regression tasks. To enhance the performance of our decision tree classifier, we'll leverage the power of Scikit-learn's `GridSearchCV` tool. It aids us in fine-tuning the hyperparameters, contributing significantly to model optimization.\n",
