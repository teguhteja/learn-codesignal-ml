    "# Lesson 5: Assessing Hierarchical Clustering Models with Scikit-learn Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to today's discussion on **Hierarchical Clustering**. We will explore its effectiveness using three key metrics: the **Silhouette Score**, the **Davies-Bouldin Index**, and **Cross-Tabulation Analysis**. Leveraging Python's powerful libraries—**scikit-learn** and **pandas**—we aim to equip you with practical skills for evaluating clustering models effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hierarchical Clustering and Scikit-learn Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scikit-learn** is a widely used Python library for machine learning. In this lesson, we'll utilize its robust built-in methods, including `silhouette_score` and `davies_bouldin_score`. Additionally, we'll implement Hierarchical Clustering using scikit-learn on a sample dataset.\n",

    "The **Silhouette Score** measures the effectiveness of our clustering by assessing how similar each point is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. Higher scores indicate better-defined clusters.\n",

    "**Visualizing and Assessing Clustered Data**\n",

    "Visualizing clustered data points provides an intuitive understanding of the clusters. We'll use **matplotlib** for visualization and **pandas' `crosstab`** method for Cross-Tabulation Analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cross-Tabulation Analysis** offers an overview of how labels are distributed across clusters.\n",
    "\n",

    "You are now equipped to apply the **Silhouette Score**, the **Davies-Bouldin Index**, and **Cross-Tabulation Analysis** to assess Hierarchical Clustering results. These tools empower you to confidently interpret and evaluate clustering models.

    "  clustering = AgglomerativeClustering(linkage='ward').fit(data)\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Determining Optimal Clusters:** Use the Silhouette Score and Davies-Bouldin Index to determine the optimal number of clusters by iterating over a range of possible cluster counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  for n_clusters in range(2, 10):\n",

    "        - A Silhouette Score of **0.548** indicates a **moderately good** clustering.\n",
    "        - Data points are reasonably well-matched to their own cluster and poorly matched to neighboring clusters.\n",
    "        - **Possible Improvement:** Adjusting `n_clusters` or other clustering parameters might yield better scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Davies-Bouldin Index: 0.201**\n",
    "    - **Interpretation:**\n",
    "        - A Davies-Bouldin Index of **0.201** suggests a **favorable clustering**.\n",
    "        - Lower values denote better distinction between clusters.\n",
    "        - The clusters are well-separated and compact.\n",

    "        - The dataset is unevenly split into **two clusters**, with **5** data points in cluster **0** and **1** data point in cluster **1**.\n",
    "        - An imbalanced cluster distribution can impact the reliability of evaluation metrics and may indicate that the selected number of clusters isn't optimal.\n",

    "    - The scatter plot displays two distinct clusters, each represented by different colors.\n",
    "    - **Observation:**\n",
    "        - **Cluster 0:** Contains the majority of the data points, forming a dense group.\n",
    "        - **Cluster 1:** Contains a single, isolated data point, which might be considered an outlier.\n",

    "### **Enhancing Clustering Performance**\n",
    "\n",
    "While the current metrics indicate a reasonable clustering outcome, there's always room for improvement. Here are some strategies to enhance clustering performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Adjust the Number of Clusters (`n_clusters`):**\n",
    "    - **Why:** Exploring different cluster counts can uncover more nuanced groupings and potentially improve evaluation metrics.\n",
    "    - **How:** Iterate over a range of `n_clusters` and evaluate corresponding metrics.\n",
    "    - **Example:**\n",
    "        \n",
    "for n in range(2, 4):\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Experiment with Different Linkage Criteria:**\n",
    "    - **Options:** `'ward'`, `'complete'`, `'average'`, `'single'`\n",
    "    - **Impact:** Affects how clusters are merged based on distance metrics.\n",
    "    - **Example:**\n",
    "        \n",
    "clustering = AgglomerativeClustering(n_clusters=2, linkage='complete').fit(data)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Scale the Data:**\n",
    "    - **Why:** Ensures that all features contribute equally to the clustering process, especially if features have different units or scales.\n",
    "    - **How:** Use `StandardScaler` or similar scaling methods.\n",
    "    - **Example:**\n",
    "        \n",
    "from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n",
    "\n",

    "scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(data)\n",
    "clustering = AgglomerativeClustering().fit(scaled_data)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Evaluate with Additional Metrics:**\n",
    "    - **Metrics:** Calinski-Harabasz Index, Dunn Index\n",
    "    - **Purpose:** Provide alternative perspectives on clustering performance.\n",
    "    - **Example:**\n",
    "        \n",
    "from sklearn.metrics import calinski_harabasz_score\n",
    "\n",
    "ch_score = calinski_harabasz_score(data, clustering.labels_)\n",
    "print(f\"Calinski-Harabasz Index: {ch_score}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Visual Inspection with More Features:**\n",
    "    - **Note:** While visualizing in 2D is straightforward, multivariate clustering might require dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA for visualization.\n",
    "    - **Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.decomposition import PCA\n",
    "\n",
    "pca = PCA(n_components=2)\n",
    "principal_components = pca.fit_transform(data)\n",

    "plt.ylabel('Principal Component 2')\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Handling Outliers:**\n",
    "    - **Why:** Outliers can skew clustering results and evaluation metrics.\n",
    "    - **How:** Detect and either remove or appropriately handle outliers before clustering.\n",
    "    - **Example:** Use Z-score or IQR methods for outlier detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Visual Comparison**\n",

    "\n",
    "While the current results are commendable, there's always room for refinement. Here are strategies to further optimize your clustering analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Experiment with Different Numbers of Clusters (`n_clusters`):**\n",
    "    - **Why:** Determining the optimal number of clusters can maximize the effectiveness of your grouping.\n",
    "    - **How:** Iterate through a range of cluster numbers and evaluate metrics.\n",

    "2. **Try Different Linkage Criteria:**\n",
    "    - **Options:** `'complete'`, `'average'`, `'single'`, `'ward'`\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Scale the Data:**\n",
    "    - **Why:** Ensures that all features contribute equally, especially if they have different units or scales.\n",
    "    - **How:** Use `StandardScaler` or similar scaling methods from `sklearn.preprocessing`.\n",

    "print(f\"Davies-Bouldin Index (Scaled Data): {db_index:.3f}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Incorporate Additional Evaluation Metrics:**\n",
    "    - **Calinski-Harabasz Index:** Measures the ratio of between-cluster variance to within-cluster variance. Higher values indicate better-defined clusters.\n",

    "\n",
    "5. **Handle Outliers:**\n",
    "    - **Why:** Outliers can distort clustering results, leading to misleading metrics.\n",
    "    - **How:** Detect and remove outliers using methods like Z-score or Interquartile Range (IQR).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
