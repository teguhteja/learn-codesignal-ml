So far, you've learned how to send basic messages to AI models, customize their parameters, and structure conversations using `SystemMessage` and `HumanMessage`. These skills have given you the foundation to create single-turn interactions with AI models. However, real-world conversations rarely consist of just one exchange.\n",

This natural flow of conversation relies on both participants remembering what was previously discussed. Without this shared context, conversations would feel disjointed and repetitive. The same principle applies when building AI applications. To create truly engaging and helpful AI assistants, we need to maintain conversation history across multiple exchanges. This allows the AI to understand references to previous messages and provide coherent, contextually appropriate responses.\n",
