You saw how to make these primitives discoverable and usable by clients, and you practiced connecting to your server and interacting with each type. This lesson will build directly on that foundation.\n",

You will see how to wrap service methods as tools, document them clearly, and make them available for clients to discover and use. By the end of this lesson, you will be able to define, document, and implement practical MCP tools for a service, and you will know how to connect to your server and interact with these tools manually. This will prepare you for more advanced integrations, such as connecting your server to an AI agent, which we will cover in the next lesson.\n",
