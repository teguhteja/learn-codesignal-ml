You discovered how agents differ from simple chat models, explored the agent loop, and practiced running agents synchronously, asynchronously, and with streaming. This foundation is essential, as it allows you to build agents that can reason, plan, and act in multiple steps.\n",

Specifically, you will learn how to interpret the results returned by the agent, understand the structure of the `RunResult` object, and see how to use these results to chain agents together. By the end of this lesson, you will be able to extract key information from an agent’s run and use it to build more complex, multi-step workflows — such as having one agent generate a recipe and another agent write a blog post about it. This knowledge will prepare you for the hands-on practice exercises that follow.\n",
