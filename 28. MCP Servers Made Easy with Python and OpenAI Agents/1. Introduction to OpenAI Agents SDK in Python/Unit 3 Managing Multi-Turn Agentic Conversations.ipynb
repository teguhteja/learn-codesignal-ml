You saw how to extract important information from an agent’s run and how to use the `to_input_list()` method to pass context between agents. This knowledge is essential for building more advanced workflows.\n",

Many real-world applications — such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and customer support agents — require the ability to remember and build upon previous exchanges. This is what makes interactions feel natural and coherent. By the end of this lesson, you will know how to manage and update conversation history using the `to_input_list()` method, enabling your agents to handle seamless, multi-turn interactions.\n",

When you run an agent, the SDK returns a **RunResult** object that contains several useful properties: the original input, a list of new items (such as messages or tool calls), the final output, and the last agent executed. One of the most important features for multi-turn conversations is the `to_input_list()` method.\n",

                                    "The `to_input_list()` method is designed to make managing conversation history easy. When you call this method on a **RunResult** object, it returns a list of message dictionaries. Each dictionary has a **role** (either `\"user\"` or `\"assistant\"`) and a **content** field containing the text of the message. This format matches what the agent expects as input for the next turn. This method gives you the full conversation history in a format that the agent can understand for the next turn.\n",

                                    "Preserving conversation history is crucial in multi-turn interactions. Without it, the agent would treat each message as a brand-new conversation, forgetting everything that happened before. By keeping track of both user and assistant messages, you ensure that the agent can respond in a way that makes sense, referencing earlier parts of the conversation as needed.\n",
