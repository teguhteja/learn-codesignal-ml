MCP is an open standard designed to enable large language models (LLMs) to securely and efficiently connect with external applications, tools, and data sources through a unified protocol. By providing a standardized way for AI models to access and interact with real-time information, MCP makes it possible to build more capable, context-aware agents that can perform complex tasks and integrate seamlessly with a wide range of systems.\n",
