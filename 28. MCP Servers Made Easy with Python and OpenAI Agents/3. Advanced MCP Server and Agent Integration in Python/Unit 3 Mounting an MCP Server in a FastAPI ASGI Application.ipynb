The handshake at `/mcp/sse` establishes a real-time connection, allowing the server to send events and instructions back to the agent. After the handshake, when the agent needs to use a tool, the client sends requests to the `/mcp/messages` endpoint as directed by the server. The MCP server processes these requests—such as adding an item to a shopping list or retrieving data—and sends the results back through the established SSE connection. This separation of endpoints keeps communication organized and efficient, and by mounting your MCP server at `/mcp`, your application structure remains clean and scalable for more complex scenarios.\n",
