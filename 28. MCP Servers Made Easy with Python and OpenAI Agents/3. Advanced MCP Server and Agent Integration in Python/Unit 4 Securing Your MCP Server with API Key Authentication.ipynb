This allowed you to serve both your agent tools and regular web API endpoints from a single, scalable app. By combining FastAPI’s flexibility with the power of the MCP server, you are now able to build modern applications that can handle both standard API requests and agent tool calls in one place.\n",

Without proper protection, someone could misuse your tools, overload your server, or even access private data. That is why, in this lesson, you will learn how to secure your MCP server using **API key authentication**. This will help you control who can access your tools and ensure that only trusted agents or users are allowed in.\n",
