Ridge Regression is a special type of linear regression that helps when we have too many features (or variables) in our data. Imagine you have a lot of different ingredients for a recipe but don't know which ones are essential. Ridge Regression helps us decide which ingredients (or features) are important without overloading the recipe.\n",
