    "# Lesson 2: Building and Analyzing Graphs with the Adjacency List\n",
    "\n",
    "Greetings! Welcome to the next stage of our journey in the \"Mastering Graphs in Python\" course! Up to this point, we've explored graph structures and adjacency matrices in great detail, uncovering the mechanics behind these critical data structures. In today's session, we'll delve into another essential graph representation: the adjacency list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider your friends list on a social networking site like Facebook; this can be viewed as a classic example of an adjacency list. Each person on Facebook has a list of connections (or friends), and you can discover mutual connections by examining the overlap in your friends lists. That's precisely how adjacency lists function!\n",
    "\n",
    "The adjacency list representation is generally more space-efficient for storing sparse graphs compared to adjacency matrices. We'll begin by theoretically understanding adjacency lists and then illustrate how to implement them in Python. We'll then learn how to perform basic operations. To put theory into practice, we'll simulate a real scenario: building a social network graph using an adjacency list. So, let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding Adjacency Lists in Graph Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into the implementation, let's familiarize ourselves with the concept of adjacency lists. An adjacency list simplifies a graph into its most essential and straightforward form. It's similar to creating a contacts list on your phone, where you have a compendium of everyone you can call. Likewise, in a graph, every node keeps a list, akin to a contacts list, of the nodes it's connected to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's further refine our understanding with a simple example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have four interconnected cities shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, cities are our vertices, and roads connecting them are our edges. The adjacency list for this graph would appear as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "San Diego: San Francisco, Los Angeles, Las Vegas  \n",
    "San Francisco: San Diego, Los Angeles  \n",
    "Los Angeles: San Diego, San Francisco, Las Vegas  \n",
    "Las Vegas: San Diego, Los Angeles\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This adjacency list informs us, for instance, that San Diego is connected to San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas - much like a city roadmap!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating an Adjacency List for a Graph in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to Python, the built-in dictionaries and lists are invaluable for representing adjacency lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an adjacency list representation, dictionaries function exceptionally well. The keys represent the nodes of the graph, and the corresponding values are lists containing the adjacent nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can translate the city roadmap mentioned above into a Python dictionary as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "roadmap = {\n",
    "    'San Diego': ['San Francisco', 'Los Angeles', 'Las Vegas'],\n",
    "    'San Francisco': ['San Diego', 'Los Angeles'],\n",
    "    'Los Angeles': ['San Diego', 'San Francisco', 'Las Vegas'],\n",
    "    'Las Vegas': ['San Diego', 'Los Angeles']\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This adjacency representation is highly efficient for sparse graphs wherein the number of edges is much less than the square of the number of vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Performing Basic Operations on Adjacency Lists in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have an adjacency list, performing basic operations becomes a breeze. Since our adjacency list is essentially a dictionary of lists, adding a vertex is as simple as adding a new key-value pair to our dictionary. In the same vein, adding an edge entails merely adding a new element to the pertinent list. Ascertaining the existence of an edge is just as straightforward; all we need to do is check if a vertex exists in another vertex’s list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how these operations translate into Python code:\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to add a new city (let's say 'Seattle') to our roadmap, we write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "roadmap['Seattle'] = []\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To add a new road (refer to edge in graph theory) from San Diego to Seattle, we simply need to add 'Seattle' to San Diego's list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "roadmap['San Diego'].append('Seattle')    # Adds an edge between San Diego and Seattle.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To verify if a road (edge) exists between San Diego and Seattle, we look up 'Seattle' in San Diego's list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "exists = 'Seattle' in roadmap['San Diego']  # Returns True.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mapping Real-world Scenarios to Theory: Building a Social Network Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjacency lists find myriad practical applications. One notable example is social networks like Facebook or LinkedIn. In such networks, each individual represents a node in the graph. When two people become friends or connections, an edge forms between their corresponding nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider three friends: 'John', 'Emma', and 'Sam'. We can model their friendships using an adjacency list as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "friends_network = {\n",
    "    'John': ['Emma', 'Sam'],\n",
    "    'Emma': ['John', 'Sam'],\n",
    "    'Sam': ['John', 'Emma']\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This adjacency list tells us that John, Emma, and Sam are all friends with each other - a classic 'Friends List'!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations on your progress! You've just expanded your knowledge of graph structures by mastering adjacency lists. An adjacency list is a straightforward, no-frills method of representing a graph's structure, explicitly listing all neighbors for each vertex. It also offers the added benefit of being more space-efficient compared to adjacency matrices, especially for sparse graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, you've understood what adjacency lists are and how to create one for a graph using Python. You've become proficient in performing basic operations like adding a vertex, adding an edge, and checking if an edge exists. Last but certainly not least, you've delved into real-world scenarios of adjacency lists by building a social network graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time to Put Theory into Practice!\n",
    "\n",
    "Next up, we have an exciting array of hands-on exercises that will allow you to flex your skills with adjacency lists. These exercises will give you an opportunity to apply what you've learned and experience firsthand how adjacency lists are used in real-world situations. Stay tuned and gear up for some engaging exercises!\n"

    "This Python code efficiently builds and manages a simple social network graph using an **adjacency list**. Let’s break down what happens step by step, and you can run the provided code to see how the graph evolves:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initializing the Graph:**\n",
    "   - The graph starts as an empty dictionary: `friends_network = {}`.\n",
    "   - Each person (node) in the network is represented by a key, with an empty list as the value to indicate that they have no friends yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Adding Vertices (People):**\n",
    "   - The vertices are added by simply adding keys to the dictionary:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     friends_network[\"John\"] = [] \n",
    "     friends_network[\"Emma\"] = []  \n",
    "     friends_network[\"Sam\"] = []\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Displaying the Graph:**\n",
    "   - At this point, the graph contains people but no connections. Printing it will show:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     {\"John\": [], \"Emma\": [], \"Sam\": []}\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Adding Edges (Friendships):**\n",
    "   - Adding a friendship involves appending to both individuals' lists, making the graph bidirectional:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     friends_network[\"John\"].append(\"Emma\")\n",
    "     friends_network[\"Emma\"].append(\"John\")\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Similarly, mutual friendships between \"Emma\" and \"Sam\", and \"John\" and \"Sam\" are added:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     friends_network[\"Emma\"].append(\"Sam\")\n",
    "     friends_network[\"Sam\"].append(\"Emma\")\n",
    "     friends_network[\"John\"].append(\"Sam\")\n",
    "     friends_network[\"Sam\"].append(\"John\")\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - After adding these edges, the graph becomes:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     {\n",
    "         \"John\": [\"Emma\", \"Sam\"],\n",
    "         \"Emma\": [\"John\", \"Sam\"],\n",
    "         \"Sam\": [\"Emma\", \"John\"]\n",
    "     }\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Checking if an Edge Exists:**\n",
    "   - To check if two people are friends, you can simply look if one person is in the list of the other:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     edge_exists = \"Sam\" in friends_network[\"John\"]\n",
    "     print(f\"There exists an edge between John and Sam: {edge_exists}\")  # Expect True\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Adding a New Vertex and Edge:**\n",
    "   - A new person, \"Sarah\", is added, and a friendship with \"Sam\" is established:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     friends_network[\"Sarah\"] = [] \n",
    "     friends_network[\"Sarah\"].append(\"Sam\")\n",
    "     friends_network[\"Sam\"].append(\"Sarah\")\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - After this, the graph will look like:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     {\n",
    "         \"John\": [\"Emma\", \"Sam\"],\n",
    "         \"Emma\": [\"John\", \"Sam\"],\n",
    "         \"Sam\": [\"Emma\", \"John\", \"Sarah\"],\n",
    "         \"Sarah\": [\"Sam\"]\n",
    "     }\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Output:\n",
    "Running the code will produce the following outputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. After adding vertices:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   The Graph after adding vertices: {'John': [], 'Emma': [], 'Sam': []}\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. After adding edges:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   The Graph after adding edges: {'John': ['Emma', 'Sam'], 'Emma': ['John', 'Sam'], 'Sam': ['Emma', 'John']}\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Checking if edges exist:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   There exists an edge between John and Sam: True\n",
    "   There exists an edge between Emma and John: True\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. After adding Sarah and her friendship with Sam:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   The Graph after adding Sarah and her friendship with Sam: {'John': ['Emma', 'Sam'], 'Emma': ['John', 'Sam'], 'Sam': ['Emma', 'John', 'Sarah'], 'Sarah': ['Sam']}\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "- This code demonstrates basic operations for building and managing a graph using adjacency lists.\n",
    "- It shows how to add nodes, form edges (friendships), and check for existing relationships.\n",
    "- It’s a simple yet powerful way to represent social networks or any kind of graph with nodes and edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to experiment with it by adding more friends or making other changes!"

    "Great! Let's extend the `tour_route` graph to include the new route between the **Sphinx** and the **Pyramids of Giza**. We need to do two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add the new vertices: **Pyramids of Giza**, **Sphinx**, **Ancient Memphis**, and **Egyptian Museum** to the graph.\n",
    "2. Create a two-way route between the **Sphinx** and the **Pyramids of Giza**.\n",
    "\n",

    "```python\n",
    "# Defining an empty dictionary to represent the Adjacency List of our graph\n",
    "tour_route = {}\n",

    "\n",
    "### Explanation of Changes:\n",
    "- Added **Pyramids of Giza** and **Sphinx** to the graph as keys.\n",
    "- Created the **two-way route** between the **Sphinx** and the **Pyramids of Giza** by appending each location to the other's adjacency list.\n",
    "- Retained the existing two-way routes between **Sphinx**, **Ancient Memphis**, and **Egyptian Museum**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the graph includes a direct route from the **Sphinx** to the **Pyramids of Giza**, as well as the previously defined routes."
