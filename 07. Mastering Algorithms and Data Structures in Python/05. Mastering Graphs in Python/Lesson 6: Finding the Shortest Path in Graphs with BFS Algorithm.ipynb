    "Hello and welcome!  \n",
    "In today's lesson, we will delve into the practical application of the **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** algorithm to solve intriguing algorithmic problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll focus on a popular challenge — **finding the shortest path from a source to a destination** in an unweighted, connected, and undirected graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem appears frequently in domains such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🗺️ Spatial networks  \n",
    "- 👥 Social networks  \n",

    "\n",
    "Imagine you're working for a **logistics company** operating in a bustling city.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🚏 Pickup and drop-off points are represented as **nodes**.\n",
    "- 🔁 Routes between points are represented as **edges**, and are **bidirectional**.\n",
    "- 🧭 The graph is **undirected**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Goal:\n",
    "Find the **shortest path** from a given **source** node to a **destination** node.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## 🧠 Shortest Path: Naive Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "A basic strategy might be to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate **all possible paths** from the source to the destination.\n",
    "2. Then choose the **shortest one**.\n",

    "### ✅ Why BFS?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ideal for **unweighted graphs**  \n",
    "- Explores all nodes at a given \"depth\" before moving deeper  \n",
    "- Ensures **minimal distance** is found for each node\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔁 How it Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Depth 0 → Start node (distance = 0)  \n",
    "- Depth 1 → All immediate neighbors (distance = 1)  \n",
    "- Depth 2 → Neighbors of neighbors (distance = 2)  \n",
    "- ... and so on\n",
    "\n",
    "➡️ BFS guarantees that the **first time a node is visited**, it’s through the **shortest possible path**.\n",

You can write your map as an adjacency list where each node is a planet, and its list is the neighboring planets you can reach.\n",

    "To solve this problem of finding the shortest path in an unweighted, undirected graph, we can utilize **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**. BFS is ideal for finding the shortest path in such graphs because it explores all the neighbors at the current depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This guarantees that when we reach a node, it's through the shortest path.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to implement BFS for shortest path:\n",
    "1. **Queue Initialization**: We begin with a queue that starts with the start node. The queue will store paths (not just nodes), so each item in the queue is a list representing a path from the start node.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **Visited Set**: A set to track the nodes we've already visited to avoid revisiting nodes and creating cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Shortest Paths Dictionary**: A dictionary to store the shortest path to each node. The key will be the node, and the value will be the list of nodes in the shortest path from the start node to that node.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **BFS Iteration**: We dequeue a path, visit its last node, and add its unvisited neighbors to the queue. For each neighbor, we append the current node to the path and store the new path in the `shortest_paths` dictionary if it hasn't been visited yet.\n",

    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initialization**: \n",
    "  - We start BFS with the queue containing a list with the start node `[start]`, which is a path containing just the start node.\n",
    "  - `visited` is a set that tracks nodes we have already processed to avoid cycles.\n",
    "  - `shortest_paths` keeps track of the shortest path to each node, starting with the start node pointing to itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **BFS Process**:\n",
    "  - While the queue is not empty, we dequeue a path and look at the last node in the path (i.e., the current node).\n",
    "  - For each unvisited neighbor of the current node, we mark it as visited, create a new path by appending the neighbor to the current path, and store this new path in `shortest_paths`.\n",
    "  - The new path is then enqueued for future exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Termination**:\n",
    "  - BFS terminates when the queue is empty, which means we've found the shortest path to every reachable node.\n",
