    "# 🚀 Breadth-First Search (BFS) for Shortest Path\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello and welcome!  \n",
    "In today's lesson, we will delve into the practical application of the **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** algorithm to solve intriguing algorithmic problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll focus on a popular challenge — **finding the shortest path from a source to a destination** in an unweighted, connected, and undirected graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem appears frequently in domains such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🗺️ Spatial networks  \n",
    "- 👥 Social networks  \n",
    "- 💻 Computing  \n",
    "- 🚚 Logistics  \n",
    "\n",

    "## ❓ Shortest Path: Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're working for a **logistics company** operating in a bustling city.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🚏 Pickup and drop-off points are represented as **nodes**.\n",
    "- 🔁 Routes between points are represented as **edges**, and are **bidirectional**.\n",
    "- 🧭 The graph is **undirected**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Goal:\n",
    "Find the **shortest path** from a given **source** node to a **destination** node.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 Shortest Path: Naive Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "A basic strategy might be to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate **all possible paths** from the source to the destination.\n",
    "2. Then choose the **shortest one**.\n",
    "\n",
    "🚨 But this **brute-force** method is highly inefficient:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ❌ Poor scalability for large graphs  \n",
    "- 🐢 Sluggish performance  \n",
    "- 🧠 Exponential time complexity  \n",
    "- 💾 Memory overuse due to path storage\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚡ Shortest Path: Efficient Approach (BFS)\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we use the **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Why BFS?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ideal for **unweighted graphs**  \n",
    "- Explores all nodes at a given \"depth\" before moving deeper  \n",
    "- Ensures **minimal distance** is found for each node\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔁 How it Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Depth 0 → Start node (distance = 0)  \n",
    "- Depth 1 → All immediate neighbors (distance = 1)  \n",
    "- Depth 2 → Neighbors of neighbors (distance = 2)  \n",
    "- ... and so on\n",
    "\n",
    "➡️ BFS guarantees that the **first time a node is visited**, it’s through the **shortest possible path**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## 🛠️ Shortest Path: Solution in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from collections import deque\n",
    "\n",
    "def shortestPath(n, graph, start, end):\n",
    "    # The queue stores tuples `(distance, path)`\n",
    "    # where `distance` is the minimal distance to the current vertex\n",
    "    # and `path` is the shortest path from the starting vertex to the current vertex\n",
    "    queue = deque([(0, [start])])\n",
    "    visited = set([start])\n",
    "    min_distances = {start: 0}\n",
    "    \n",
    "    while queue:\n",
    "        distance, path = queue.popleft()\n",
    "        node = path[-1]\n",
    "        min_distances[node] = distance\n",
    "\n",
    "        if node == end:\n",
    "            return distance, path\n",
    "        \n",
    "        for neighbor in graph[node]:\n",
    "            if neighbor not in visited:\n",
    "                visited.add(neighbor)\n",
    "                queue.append((distance + 1, path + [neighbor]))\n",
    "\n",
    "    return float('inf'), []\n",
