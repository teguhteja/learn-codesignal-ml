    "# Lesson 6: Mastering Binary Search Trees: Understanding, Implementation, and Application in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Dear students, today's session is an exciting journey into the world of **Binary Search Trees (BSTs)**! Up until now, in our *Understanding and Using Trees in Python* course, you've gained extensive knowledge about a variety of tree structures, explored the Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS), and learned about Heaps in detail. Today, we're progressing to another fundamental subject that leverages the tree structure to optimize data storage and searching processes — the Binary Search Tree (BST).\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, Binary Search Trees are excellent data structures that optimize search operations by appropriately arranging data elements based on certain properties. These trees' **\"left-small, right-large\"** order property helps ensure fast search, insertion, and deletion operations. Essentially, BSTs are tree structures designed to make data retrieval and storage efficient and simpler.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ultimate goal of today's lesson is three-fold:\n",
    "1. Understand the intricate workings of BSTs.\n",
    "2. Implement them in Python using the CodeSignal IDE.\n",
    "3. Apply this knowledge to solve complex algorithmic problems leveraging BSTs.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, without further ado, let's set out on this exciting exploration of BSTs!\n",

    "# Understanding Binary Search Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary Search Trees (BSTs) are named for their binary nodal structure, where each node links to two child nodes—much like a binary tree. However, what differentiates them is a crucial property: **every node ensures that the values in its left subtree are less than or equal to its value, and the values in its right subtree are greater than its value**. This property facilitates highly efficient search operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's illuminate this concept with a simple instance. Consider the BST below:\n",
    "- The root node is `5`.\n",
    "- Its left subtree contains the values `1`, `3`, and `4` (all less than `5`).\n",
    "- Its right subtree contains the values `6` and `9` (both larger than `5`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The same condition holds for all other nodes in the tree. This example provides a clear insight into the underlying logic that governs BST node placement.\n",

    "# Implementing Binary Search Trees in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining the Node Class\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Node** represents a structure wherein each node contains a reference to its left and right children and holds some data — the node's value.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Node:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, val):\n",
    "        self.left = None\n",
    "        self.right = None\n",
    "        self.val = val\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constructing a BST\n",
    "\n",
    "With the `Node` class defined, we can now construct our BST by creating new node instances and linking them together:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "root = Node(5)\n",
    "root.left = Node(3)\n",
    "root.right = Node(9)\n",
    "root.left.left = Node(1)\n",
    "root.left.right = Node(4)\n",
    "root.right.left = Node(6)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This snippet successfully constructs a BST structure in Python matching the example discussed earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# BST Operations: Insertion\n",
    "\n",
    "To maintain the BST property during insertion, a new value `x` must be carefully positioned:\n",
    "- Start at the root and traverse down the BST.\n",
    "- If `x` is less than the current node's value, go left.\n",
    "- If it's greater, move to the right child.\n",
    "- Continue until finding an appropriate spot (a `None` child), then insert `x` as a new node at that location.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how to implement the insert operation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def insert(root, key):\n",
    "    if root is None:\n",
    "        return Node(key)\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        if key > root.val:\n",
    "            root.right = insert(root.right, key)\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            root.left = insert(root.left, key)\n",

    "\n",
    "# BST Operations: Searching\n",
    "\n",
    "Searching helps us determine if a value exists in the BST:\n",
    "- Start at the root and traverse down the tree.\n",
    "- If the key is greater than the current node's value, move right; if it's smaller, move left.\n",
    "- If the key is found or the tree is empty, return the node (or `None` if not found).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the Python implementation for a search operation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def search(root, key):\n",
    "    if root is None or root.val == key:\n",
    "        return root\n",
    "    if key > root.val:\n",

    "\n",
    "# BST Operations: Deletion\n",
    "\n",
    "Deleting a node while maintaining the BST property involves several steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Leaf Node:** If the node is a leaf, delete it outright.\n",
    "2. **Single Child:** If the node has only one child, replace it with its child.\n",
    "3. **Two Children:** If the node has two children, find its in-order successor (the smallest value in its right subtree) or its in-order predecessor (the largest value in its left subtree), replace the node's value with that value, and then delete the successor or predecessor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Helper Function: Finding the Minimum Value Node\n",

    "The space complexity for these operations is **O(h)** in the worst case due to the recursive call stack. In a balanced BST, this becomes **O(log n)**. However, if the BST becomes skewed (unbalanced), time complexity can degrade to **O(n)**.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Class `Node`:**\n",
    "   - This class defines a node in the BST, which holds a value (`val`) and pointers to its left and right child nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Function `insert_BST`:**\n",
    "   - This function inserts a new node into the BST by comparing the node’s value with the root. If the value is less than the root’s value, it is inserted into the left subtree. Otherwise, it is inserted into the right subtree.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Function `in_order_traversal`:**\n",
    "   - This function performs an in-order traversal of the BST and prints each node's value. It visits the left subtree, then the current node, followed by the right subtree.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Function `delete_node_with_val`:**\n",
    "   - This function deletes a node with a given value from the BST. It handles three cases:\n",
    "     - The node is a leaf (no children).\n",
    "     - The node has one child.\n",
    "     - The node has two children (finds the in-order successor, swaps values, and deletes the successor).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Function `find_min_value_node`:**\n",
    "   - This helper function finds the node with the smallest value in a given subtree by traversing leftward until it reaches a leaf.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **In-order traversal before deletion:**\n",
    "   - This prints the elements of the BST in sorted order before deleting a node.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **In-order traversal after deletion:**\n",
    "   - This shows the BST's structure after deleting the node with value `2`.\n",

    "### Identifying and Fixing the Issue\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem in your code is in the `bst_insert` function, specifically in how you're handling the insertion logic. You are assigning `None` to the left or right child instead of inserting the new node correctly. In the `bst_insert` function, when you attempt to add a node, you should be assigning the new node to the appropriate position in the tree, not assigning `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What needs to be fixed?\n",
    "1. **Inserting the node**: When the current node's left or right child is `None`, you should assign the new node to that position.\n",
    "2. **Recursive calls**: If there is already a node at the position where you want to insert the new node, you should continue the recursive call until you find the appropriate position in the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Corrected Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class TreeNode:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, val):\n",
    "        self.left = None\n",

    "# Perform an in-order traversal of the BST\n",
    "bst_traversal_inorder(r)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of Fixes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Inserting the Node**: When we call `bst_insert` recursively, we check if the left or right child is `None`. If it is, we assign the new node to that position. This ensures that the new node is correctly inserted into the tree.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Return the root**: After recursively inserting the node into the correct position, we return the root of the tree. This is necessary to maintain the reference to the root node as we traverse and modify the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **In-order Traversal**: This part remains the same. It traverses the tree in in-order (left, root, right), which will print the values of the nodes in sorted order (since it's a BST).\n",
