Instead of calculating the height of each node separately, which involves repeated traversal, we can implement a `check_balance` function that computes both the height of the tree and checks balance in one recursive traversal. The function should return an indicator `is_balanced = False` when the tree is unbalanced to allow for early termination without visiting all nodes.
