    "Here's the complete Python function that checks the existence of a test element in both a list and a set 100 times, and then prints the time it took for each operation:\n",

    "### Explanation:\n",
    "- **Data Structures**: A list (`data_list`) and a set (`data_set`) are populated with one million integers (`0` to `999,999`).\n",
    "- **Test Item**: The `test_item` is set to `1,000,001`, which is not present in either the list or the set.\n",
    "- **Time Measurement**: The code uses `time.time()` to measure how long it takes to check if `test_item` is in the `data_set` and `data_list` 100 times.\n",
    "- **Performance**: The set operations are expected to be faster than list operations due to the average constant time complexity (`O(1)`) for lookups in sets compared to the linear time complexity (`O(n)`) for lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Output:\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Time taken for 100 checks in set: 0.000154 seconds\n",
    "Time taken for 100 checks in list: 0.762346 seconds\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This example output shows that checking the presence of an item in a set is significantly faster than checking in a list, especially as the size of the dataset grows."
