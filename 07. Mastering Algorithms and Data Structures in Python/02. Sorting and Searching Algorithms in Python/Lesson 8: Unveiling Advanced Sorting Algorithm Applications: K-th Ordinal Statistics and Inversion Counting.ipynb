Today, we will focus on two distinct problems: \"Find the K-th Ordinal Statistic in a List\" and \"Count the Number of Inversions in a List\". These problems mirror practical scenarios, and the efficient techniques used to solve them provide valuable demonstrations of sorting algorithms. We'll see how Quick Sort and Merge Sort are applicable and help us achieve efficient solutions for both problems.\n",
