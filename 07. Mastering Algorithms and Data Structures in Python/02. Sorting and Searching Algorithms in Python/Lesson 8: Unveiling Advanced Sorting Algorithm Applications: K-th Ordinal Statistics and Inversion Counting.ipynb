                "Welcome to this insightful session, where we aim to master the complexities of advanced sorting algorithm applications. Today, we will focus on two distinct problems: \"Find the K-th Ordinal Statistic in a List\" and \"Count the Number of Inversions in a List\". These problems mirror practical scenarios, and the efficient techniques used to solve them provide valuable demonstrations of sorting algorithms. We'll see how Quick Sort and Merge Sort are applicable and help us achieve efficient solutions for both problems.\n",

For example, if `k = 1`, you're seeking the smallest element; if `k = 2`, you're searching for the second smallest element, and so on. By the end of this lesson, you'll be adept at solving this problem!\n",

For an odd-numbered dataset, the median is the k-th ordinal statistic, where `k` is at the midpoint of the dataset length. Mastering this problem is crucial for finding medians or other ordinal statistics in real-world datasets.\n",
