    "# Lesson 3: Mastering Continuous Functions with Binary Search in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Hello everyone, and welcome back to another exciting lesson! Today, we embark on an intriguing journey of applying the binary search algorithm, which we have thoroughly covered in previous lessons, to **continuous functions**. This lesson aims to spark your curiosity and expand your understanding of binary search. It will provide new insights on how to determine a specific function value within a continuous interval, broadening the application of binary search from discrete space to continuous functions. So, let's unravel this exciting topic together!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding Continuous Functions\n",
    "Before diving into binary search and continuous functions, let's refresh our understanding of continuous functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **continuous function** produces smooth, unbroken output for a continuous range of inputs without any abrupt changes or gaps. In mathematical terms, a function \\( f(x) \\) is continuous at a point \\( x = a \\) if the limit of \\( f(x) \\) as \\( x \\) approaches \\( a \\) from the left is equal to the limit as it approaches from the right, and these values are equal to \\( f(a) \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "This property is crucial because it ensures the function maintains an order, allowing us to apply binary search to continuous functions, even though they aren't sorted in the traditional sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Binary Search Recap\n",
    "Binary search is a powerful search algorithm with logarithmic time complexity. It repeatedly divides the search interval in half and compares the middle element with the target. If the middle element matches the target, the position is returned. Otherwise, the search continues in either the left or right half.\n",
    "\n",
    "When applied to continuous functions, instead of comparing a list's middle element, we compare the function value \\( f(x) \\) at the midpoint and adjust our search boundaries accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Finding the Function Value with Binary Search\n",
    "Let's break down the steps for finding a specific function value using binary search:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define the interval**: Set the left and right bounds \\([ \\text{left}, \\text{right} )\\) where the function value could exist.\n",
    "2. **Precision setting**: Continue narrowing the interval until the difference between the bounds is smaller than a tiny number \\( \\epsilon \\) (the precision).\n",
    "3. **Midpoint calculation**: Calculate the midpoint \\( m = \\frac{\\text{left} + \\text{right}}{2} \\).\n",
    "4. **Update the interval**: If \\( f(m) \\) is less than the target, set left to \\( m \\); otherwise, set right to \\( m \\).\n",
    "5. **Repeat**: Continue until the interval is sufficiently small, and the function value is as close to the target as desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the function \\( f(x) = x^2 - 2 \\). Let's find \\( x \\) such that \\( f(x) = 0 \\) within the interval \\([1, 2]\\):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Define the function\n",
    "def f(x):\n",
    "    return x * x - 2\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define the binary search function\n",
    "def binary_search(target, left, right, precision):\n",
    "    while right - left > precision:\n",
    "        mid = (left + right) / 2\n",
    "        if f(mid) < target:  # If midpoint value is less than target\n",
    "            left = mid  # Update left boundary\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            right = mid  # Update right boundary\n",
    "    return left  # Return final left boundary\n",
    "\n",
    "# Set precision and run the search\n",
    "epsilon = 1e-6\n",
    "result = binary_search(0, 1, 2, epsilon)\n",
    "print(\"x for which f(x) is approximately 0:\", result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "x for which f(x) is approximately 0: 1.4142131805419922\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implications of Precision\n",
    "In the binary search function, the precision \\( \\epsilon \\) dictates how close the result is to the target. A smaller \\( \\epsilon \\) increases the precision but also increases the number of iterations needed, making the algorithm run longer. Choosing an appropriate \\( \\epsilon \\) balances accuracy and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applying the Technique to a Complex Problem\n",
    "With binary search on continuous functions, we can tackle a wide range of problems. For instance, in physics, finding when an object's velocity \\( V(t) = 9.81 \\times t - 0.65 \\times t^2 \\) equals a target value within a given time range can be efficiently solved with binary search.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Wrapping Up\n",
    "We've explored how binary search can be applied to continuous functions, discussed the significance of precision, and implemented a Python solution. This opens up possibilities for solving real-world problems efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ready for Practice?\n",
    "Now it's time to practice! Applying what you've learned through exercises will solidify your understanding. So, let's dive into some practice problems and take your skills to the next level. Happy coding!\n",

This approach broadens the application of binary search from discrete space to continuous functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding Continuous Functions\n",
    "Before we dive into binary search and continuous functions, let's refresh our understanding of what exactly continuous functions are. In the simplest terms, a function is a mapping from an input (or set of inputs) to an output. For instance, if we think about a Python function, it takes one or more arguments and returns an output based on the logic embedded within the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuous functions are those that produce a smooth, unbroken output for a continuous range of inputs without any abrupt changes or gaps. In mathematical terms, a function f(x) is continuous at a point x=a if the limit of f(x) as x approaches a from the left is equal to the limit of f(x) as x approaches a from the right, and these values are equal to f(a). That means that:\n",
    "\n",
    "lim x→a− f(x) = lim x→a+ f(x) = f(a)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where lim x→a− f(x) and lim x→a+ f(x) represent the limit of f(x) as x approaches a from the left and the right, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in real life, the function that relates the time of day to the temperature outside is continuous (although it may go up and down). It's a natural phenomenon that temperature doesn't make abrupt jumps.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Binary Search Recap\n",
    "You might recall from previous lessons that binary search is a powerful search algorithm with a logarithmic running time. It searches a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. In each step, it compares the middle element with the target item. If the middle element matches the target item, its position in the list is returned. However, if the target item is greater than the middle element, the search continues on the right half of the list and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Finding the Function Value with Binary Search\n",
    "The mechanism of binary search remains much the same, but instead of comparing the middle element to the target, we compare the middle point x's function value f(x) to the target. We continuously narrow down an interval until we reach an interval small enough that the function value within it is as close to the target as we demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps for Implementation:\n",
    "1. Define the left and right bounds of the binary search within which the function takes on our target value\n",
    "2. Define a loop that runs until the difference between left and right is smaller than a very small number ϵ (precision)\n",
    "3. Compute the midpoint: m = (left + right) / 2\n",
    "4. Compute f(m) and compare with target value\n",
    "5. Update bounds accordingly until required precision is achieved\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Implementation:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Define the function\n",
    "def f(x):\n",
    "    return x * x - 2\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define the binary search function \n",
    "def binary_search(target, left, right, precision):\n",
    "    while right - left > precision:\n",
    "        mid = (left + right) / 2\n",
    "        if f(mid) < target:  # If the midpoint value is less than the target...\n",
    "            left = mid       # ...update the left boundary to be the midpoint.\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            right = mid      # Otherwise, update the right boundary.\n",
    "    return left  # Return the left boundary of our final, narrow interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "epsilon = 1e-6\n",
    "result = binary_search(0, 1, 2, epsilon)\n",
    "print(\"x for which f(x) is approximately 0:\", result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implications of Precision\n",
    "The precision value ϵ (set as 10^-6 in our example) determines the accuracy of our result. A smaller ϵ means higher precision but requires more iterations of the while loop, presenting a trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-World Application\n",
    "Consider a physics problem where we need to find the time t at which a velocity function V(t) = 9.81*t - 0.65*t² equals a specific target value. Instead of checking every second (discretization), we can use binary search for a more efficient solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "We've expanded our understanding of binary search by applying it to continuous functions. This technique opens up new possibilities for solving complex problems in various fields, from mathematics to physics and beyond.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practice Recommendation\n",
    "The best way to solidify your understanding is through practice. Try implementing binary search for different continuous functions and experiment with various precision values to understand their impact on the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Happy coding!"

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This program calculates the time it takes for a ball to fall 100 meters using binary search. Let's break down how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The height function `h(t)` models the ball's position at time t:\n",
    "   - h(t) = initial_height - (1/2) * g * t²\n",

    "\n",
    "2. The binary search looks for the time when height = 0 (ground)\n",
    "   - It searches between 0 and 10 seconds\n",
    "   - Uses precision of 10⁻⁶ seconds\n",
    "\n",
    "Running the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Time when the ball hits the ground (seconds):  4.516122341156006\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This result means it takes approximately 4.52 seconds for the ball to hit the ground. Let's verify this makes sense:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using the formula h(t) = 100 - (0.5)(9.81)(4.52²)\n",
    "2. At t ≈ 4.52s, h(t) ≈ 0 meters (ground level)\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstrates how binary search can find precise solutions for physical problems by working with continuous functions. The algorithm kept dividing the time interval until it found when the height function equals zero, giving us the exact moment of impact.\n",

    "## Determining the Optimal Coffee Temperature with Binary Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Great job, Cosmic Coder! You've been effectively utilizing binary search on continuous functions — an interstellar effort indeed. Now, it's time to apply this proficiency to an intriguing real-world challenge. Let's imagine that you're an astronaut who brewed coffee at a temperature of 90 degrees, which transpires to be too hot to drink. Over time, as your coffee cools, its taste begins to change. At around 70 degrees, you notice your brew tastes optimal, yet you strive for precision. Recently, you had thought that the optimal temperature would be obtained when the value of the coffee function is 30, so now you're trying to understand which temperature maps to this coffee function value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Should you choose to accept your mission, you will need to modify the starter code to pinpoint the exact temperature T at which your coffee tastes superior, i.e., coffee_function(T) = 30. At the point where the taste of the coffee peaks, you will find the optimal temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your objective: tweak the binary search function to identify this temperature. Good luck!\n",
