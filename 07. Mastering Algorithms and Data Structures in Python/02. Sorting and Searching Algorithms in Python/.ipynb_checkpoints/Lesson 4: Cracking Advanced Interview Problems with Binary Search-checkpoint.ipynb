    "# Lesson 4: Cracking Advanced Interview Problems with Binary Search\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to the Lesson\n",
    "Today, we're delving into the important topic of advanced interview problems revolving around **Binary Search**. You're likely familiar with the concept of Binary Search – it's an efficient algorithm for finding a specific target in a sorted list by repetitively dividing the search interval in half. Today, we will reinforce our understanding by tackling complex data science interview problems using Binary Search.\n",

    "### Problem 1: Search in a Rotated Sorted Array\n",
    "Imagine a sorted array of integers that has been rotated at an unknown pivot point. This list maintains its sorted order but now starts from a random position. Your task is to find a specific target value within this array and return its index. If the target isn't present, return `-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "Initial sorted array: `[1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 15]`,  \n",
    "Rotated version: `[8, 9, 11, 15, 1, 2, 4, 5]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Application:\n",
    "Picture a server system where processes are listed in ascending order based on their IDs. A disruption rotates this list, and now the system needs to find a process using a specific ID. A standard binary search isn't sufficient since the list, though sorted, starts at an arbitrary point.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Naive Approach:\n",
    "A simple solution involves scanning each element of the array. This has a **time complexity of O(n)**, which is inefficient for large lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Efficient Approach for Problem 1:\n",
    "We can use binary search with **O(log n)** complexity. The challenge is identifying which part of the array is sorted after the rotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define the search boundaries using two pointers: `left` and `right`. We then calculate the midpoint (`mid`). Depending on the values of `nums[left]`, `nums[mid]`, and `nums[right]`, we can determine whether to search in the left or right half of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python Code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def search_rotated(nums, target):\n",
    "    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1\n",
    "    while left <= right:\n",
    "        mid = (left + right) // 2\n",
    "        if nums[mid] == target:\n",
    "            return mid\n",

    "### Problem 2: Locate the First and Last Position of an Element in a Sorted Array\n",
    "In this problem, you are tasked with finding both the first and last positions of a certain target value in a sorted array. If the target isn't found, return `[-1, -1]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Application:\n",
    "Imagine a time-series analysis where you have a sorted array of timestamps recording user activities. You need to find the first and last instances when a user performed a certain activity.\n",

    "## Rotated Array Search Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright, cosmic coder! Here's a brain-tickling challenge for you! You're given a peculiar list of unique integers - it's sorted in a decreasing order and then rotated at a random pivot. So, while you and I know that it's still sorted, it kicks off from an unpredictable point. Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to hunt down a specific target number in this array and report its index. If the target turns up missing, return -1.\n",
    "How is the input scheduled to arrive, you ask? Well, the format is a list with positive integer elements, with possible edge cases being an array of size 1 or the target number not being present in the array! You are guaranteed that the array will always consist of unique numbers.\n",
    "You need to whip up a solution that takes this list and target number as inputs and returns the index of our target, or -1 if it's on the lam. Now, go give it whatever you've got!\n",

    "I'll help solve this interesting variation of binary search for a rotated sorted array in decreasing order. Let's think through the solution step by step.\n",
