    "# Unraveling Recursion Through Classic Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to the Lesson\n",
    "Welcome to our hands-on lesson exploring the fascinating concept of recursion through practical examples. In this lesson, we'll dive into three foundational problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generating the Fibonacci sequence\n",
    "- Finding the sum of all elements in an array\n",
    "- Calculating factorials\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll break down each problem, explain the solution, and then rebuild them using recursion. If the name Fibonacci reminds you of Fibonacci de Piso, one of the most famous mathematicians of the Middle Ages known for his work on the Fibonacci sequence, you're on the right track. Let's dive in!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem 1: Fibonacci Sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the Fibonacci Sequence?\n",
    "The Fibonacci sequence is an infinite sequence of numbers that starts with 0 and 1. Each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two:\n",
    "\n",
    "`0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...`\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a number `n`, our task is to implement a recursive algorithm that returns the n-th number in the Fibonacci sequence. Remember, the indexing starts from 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ðŸ’¡ **Fun Fact:** The Fibonacci sequence is closely connected with the golden ratio, often found in nature and art.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Naive Recursion Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Hereâ€™s a simple recursive solution to find the n-th Fibonacci number:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def fib(n): \n",
    "   if n <= 1: \n",
    "       return n \n",
    "   else: \n",
    "       return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "While this solution works, it is inefficient due to repeated calculations. For example, when calculating the 5th Fibonacci number, the 3rd Fibonacci number will be calculated multiple times. This leads to exponential time complexity `O(2^n)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Efficient Approach with Memoization\n",
    "\n",
    "To optimize, we use **memoization**â€”storing the results of previous calculations to avoid redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def fib(n, computed={0: 0, 1: 1}):\n",
    "    if n not in computed:\n",
    "        computed[n] = fib(n - 1, computed) + fib(n - 2, computed)\n",
    "    return computed[n]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This version computes the Fibonacci number in linear time `O(n)`, which is a huge improvement over the naive recursive solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem 2: Summing Array Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "Our next task is to calculate the sum of all elements in an array. Although it might seem trivial, recursion provides an elegant way to solve this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recursive Approach Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "We decompose the array sum problem by breaking it into two parts: the first element and the sum of the remaining elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def arraySum(arr, index=0): \n",
    "   if index == len(arr): \n",
    "       return 0 \n",
    "   else:\n",
    "       return arr[index] + arraySum(arr, index + 1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach uses an index to walk through the array, efficiently summing the elements without creating new arrays. The base case occurs when the index reaches the array length.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem 3: Calculating Factorial\n",
    "\n",
    "The factorial of a number `n` is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 2 * 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recursive Approach Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "The factorial of `n` can also be expressed recursively as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "n! = n * (n-1)!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def factorial(n): \n",
    "   if n == 0 or n == 1: \n",
    "       return 1\n",
    "   else:\n",
    "       return n * factorial(n - 1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For values of `n = 0` or `n = 1`, the function returns 1. For larger `n`, the function recursively computes the factorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lesson Summary\n",
    "Through these three classic problemsâ€”Fibonacci sequence, summing array elements, and calculating factorialsâ€”we've uncovered the essence of recursion. Recursion is not only a powerful computational tool but also a concept that appears in nature, art, and even storytelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've explored the foundations of recursion, are you ready to practice and master it? Letâ€™s dive into the exercises!\n",

    "- **Recursive Calculation**: If the requested Fibonacci number `n` is not already computed, it calculates it by summing the two preceding Fibonacci numbers.\n",
