    "\n",
    "# Mastering Binary Search: Implementation and Complexity Analysis in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction and Overview\n",
    "Welcome back! Today, we're adding another tool to our toolkit for algorithms and data structures — a powerful searching technique known as **binary search** that operates seamlessly on sorted arrays. By the end of this session, you will understand binary search, its internals, its Python implementation, and its time and space complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary search resembles finding a word in a dictionary. Instead of checking every page, you open the dictionary around the middle, and based on your comparison, you either continue with the left half or the right half. This halving process continues until the word is found, which is the essence of binary search.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding Binary Search\n",
    "Binary search is a search algorithm that works on a **sorted list** or array. It uses a strategy similar to looking up a name in a telephone directory or a word in the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Open the list in the middle.\n",
    "- Compare the target value with the middle element.\n",
    "- If the target is smaller, search the left half.\n",
    "- If it's larger, search the right half.\n",
    "- Repeat until you find the element or reduce the search space to nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, with a sorted list like `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]` and the target number `3`, binary search would jump to the middle element first, then narrow the search space until it finds `3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Binary Search Algorithm\n",
    "Binary search follows a **divide-and-conquer** approach. It has a time complexity of **O(log n)**, making it highly efficient for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Steps:\n",
    "1. Calculate the middle index of the list.\n",
    "2. If the middle element is equal to the target, return it.\n",
    "3. If the middle element is greater than the target, search the left half.\n",
    "4. If the middle element is less than the target, search the right half.\n",
    "5. Repeat until the search space reduces to zero or the target is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation of Binary Search in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "### Iterative Approach\n",
    "Let's implement binary search iteratively in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def binary_search_iterative(data, target):\n",
    "    low = 0\n",
    "    high = len(data)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    while high - low > 1:  # search until the interval length > 1\n",
    "        mid = (low + high) // 2\n",
    "        if target < data[mid]:\n",
    "            high = mid  # search in the left half\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            low = mid  # search in the right half\n",
    "    return low if data[low] == target else None\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This function returns the index of the target in the sorted list. If the target is not found, it returns `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recursive Approach\n",
    "We can also implement binary search using recursion:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def binary_search_recursive(data, target, low, high):\n",
    "    if high - low <= 1:\n",
    "        return low if data[low] == target else None\n",
    "    mid = (low + high) // 2\n",
    "    if target < data[mid]:\n",
    "        return binary_search_recursive(data, target, low, mid)\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return binary_search_recursive(data, target, mid, high)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this recursive version, the same logic applies, but the while loop is replaced by recursive calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analyzing Binary Search Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity:\n",
    "Binary search operates with **O(log n)** time complexity. This logarithmic time behavior makes it ideal for large datasets because it reduces the search space by half with each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity:\n",
    "- **Iterative Version:** **O(1)** because it uses a fixed amount of space.\n",
    "- **Recursive Version:** **O(log n)** due to the recursive call stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bonus Exercise: Binary Search in a Rotated Sorted List\n",
    "Now that you understand binary search, let's apply it to a more advanced problem — searching for a target element in a **rotated sorted list**. Consider a list like `[7, 8, 9, 2, 3, 4]`. How can binary search determine where a target value like `3` is located? This is a more complex problem that we'll cover in future lessons, but it's a great exercise to think about!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lesson Summary & Validation\n",
    "In this lesson, we:\n",
    "- Drew parallels between binary search and looking up words in a dictionary.\n",
    "- Explored the binary search algorithm and its Python implementation.\n",
    "- Analyzed time and space complexity.\n",
    "- Discussed advanced applications like searching in a rotated sorted list.\n",
    "\n",
    "You've mastered a critical search algorithm that will be useful in various coding challenges!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practice Exercises on the Horizon!\n",
    "Are you eager to apply what you've learned? Excellent! In the next session, we'll tackle practice exercises, including searching in a rotated sorted list. Whether you're preparing for coding interviews or just improving your skills, these problems will boost your confidence. Let's get started!\n"

    "The issue with your binary search implementation lies in the condition of the `while` loop and how the `high` index is managed. Specifically, the loop condition `while high - low >= 0:` is incorrect because it allows the loop to continue even when `low` equals `high`, which can lead to an infinite loop or an out-of-bounds error when accessing `data[mid]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To fix this, the loop condition should be `while low < high:`. This ensures that the search continues only while there are elements to check. Additionally, when updating the `low` and `high` indices, you should adjust them correctly to avoid missing the target or causing an infinite loop.\n",

    "2. **Binary Search Function**:\n",
    "   - The function `binary_search_iterative` takes a sorted list (`data`) and a `target` grade to find.\n",
    "   - It initializes `low` to `0` and `high` to the last index of the list (`len(data) - 1`).\n",
    "   - The `while` loop continues as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`.\n",
    "   - Inside the loop, it calculates the middle index (`mid`).\n",
    "   - It checks if the middle element is equal to the target. If so, it returns the index.\n",
    "   - If the middle element is less than the target, it adjusts `low` to `mid + 1` to search the right half.\n",
    "   - If the middle element is greater than the target, it adjusts `high` to `mid - 1` to search the left half.\n",
    "   - If the target is not found, it returns `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Grade Query**: We set a specific grade to search for (in this case, `70`).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Function Invocation**: The binary search function is called with the grades list and the grade query. The result is checked, and an appropriate message is printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Execution Result:\n",
    "When you run the code with the `grade_query` set to `70`, it will output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "The grade 70 is found at position 7 in the grades list.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you were to search for a grade that doesn't exist, such as `100`, it would return:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "The grade 100 is not found in the grades list.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to test the function with different grades to see how it performs!Executed 1st Code Block\n",
