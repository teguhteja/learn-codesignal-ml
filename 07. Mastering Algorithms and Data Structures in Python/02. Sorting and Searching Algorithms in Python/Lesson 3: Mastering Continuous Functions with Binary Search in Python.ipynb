Today, we embark on an intriguing journey of applying the binary search algorithm, which we have thoroughly covered in previous lessons, to **continuous functions**. This lesson aims to spark your curiosity and expand your understanding of binary search. It will provide new insights on how to determine a specific function value within a continuous interval, broadening the application of binary search from discrete space to continuous functions. So, let's unravel this exciting topic together!\n",
