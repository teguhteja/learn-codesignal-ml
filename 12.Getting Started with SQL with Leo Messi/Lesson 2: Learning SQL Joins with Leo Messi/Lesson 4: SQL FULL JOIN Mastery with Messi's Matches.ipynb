    "## Introduction to SQL FULL JOIN Mastery\n",
    "Hello there! It's great to see that you've stuck around for the next exciting topic on our soccer journey with Leo Messi's career and SQL **JOINs**. After introducing ourselves to **INNER JOIN**, **LEFT JOIN**, and **RIGHT JOIN** in the earlier lessons, we're now moving on to the fourth and final type – true to its name, the **FULL JOIN**.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL **JOINs** are essential when it comes to processing data, and having a command over **FULL JOINs** can help you effectively analyze intricate data relations. For this lesson, we will be continuing with MySQL, but remember, the understanding of SQL you garner here is transferable to other relational database management systems (RDBMS) such as PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and SQLite, with just slight differences in their syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Traversing Through JOINs and Understanding FULL JOIN\n",
    "Before we plunge into **FULL JOIN**, let's reinforce our knowledge of **JOINs**. SQL **JOINs** enable us to merge rows from two or more tables based on a common column among them. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **INNER JOIN** returns rows where there is a match in both tables. \n",
    "- **LEFT JOIN** gives all records from the left table and the matched records from the right one. \n",
    "- **RIGHT JOIN**, conversely, returns all records from the right table and the matched records from the left one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**FULL JOIN** in SQL straddles the territory between **LEFT JOIN** and **RIGHT JOIN**. It provides all records where there is a match in either the left table or the right one, essentially unifying the results of **LEFT JOIN** and **RIGHT JOIN** to offer a comprehensive view of your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This simple visual aid below can help make sense of it, where A and B are the tables we are joining and the green areas depict the results of different **JOINs**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Implementation Of SQL FULL JOIN in MySQL\n",
    "Let's put our concepts into practice using **FULL JOIN** to merge relevant data from Messi's **Matches** and **MatchEvents**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- First part: Fetch all matches and their associated events\n",
    "SELECT Matches.match_id, Matches.date, MatchEvents.event_type\n",
    "FROM Matches\n",
    "LEFT JOIN MatchEvents ON Matches.match_id = MatchEvents.match_id\n",
    "\n",
    "UNION ALL\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Second part: Retrieve events with no matching matches, ensuring we aren't omitting any data\n",
    "SELECT Matches.match_id, Matches.date, MatchEvents.event_type\n",
    "FROM Matches\n",
    "RIGHT JOIN MatchEvents ON Matches.match_id = MatchEvents.match_id\n",
    "WHERE Matches.match_id IS NULL;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sneak Peek of the Output:\n",
    "| match_id | date       | event_type         |\n",
    "|----------|------------|---------------------|\n",
    "| 1        | 2005-05-01 | Left-footed shot    |\n",
    "| 2        | 2005-11-02 | Left-footed shot    |\n",
    "\n",
    "In this query, we adopt a bifurcated strategy. The first section applies a **LEFT JOIN** to list all matches along with their corresponding events, if any. The latter section, which is essential for simulating a **FULL JOIN**, uses a **RIGHT JOIN** to cover those rows from the **MatchEvents** table that fail to find a match in the **Matches** table (we ensure this by checking `WHERE Matches.match_id IS NULL`).\n",
    "\n",
    "By joining these two parts through **UNION ALL**, we effectively simulate a **FULL JOIN**, yielding a complete view that includes all matched and unmatched records from both tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Managing NULL Values in FULL JOIN Operations\n",
    "In the query we've just dissected, the condition `WHERE Matches.match_id IS NULL` in the second select statement plays a crucial role. This ensures that only those records from the **MatchEvents** table are added that are not in the **Matches** table. By handling **NULL** values in this way, we ensure that our dataset is complete, which is extremely valuable for data analysts who want to cover all possible angles in their exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lesson Recap\n",
    "You've now learned how to emulate a **FULL JOIN** in MySQL, developing queries that provide a thorough understanding of the relationships between Messi's matches and match events. Today's lesson involved a meticulous application of SQL, giving you an improved set of technical skills and a more refined critical approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you move on to the practice exercises, remember the structured method of merging **LEFT JOIN** and **RIGHT JOIN** operations. This will help solidify your understanding and demonstrate how malleable SQL techniques can solve even the most convoluted data problems. Remember, continue to apply your knowledge with imagination and precision!"

    "## Exploring Matches and Match Events\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, we will extend our SQL query to retrieve data about matches from different seasons, including specific match events. The task will involve joining multiple tables to acquire detailed information about each match and specific events that occurred during them.\n",
    "\n",
    "-- TODO: Retrieve all matches, their corresponding events\n",
    "SELECT Matches.date, ____________ \n",
    "FROM Matches \n",
    "RIGHT JOIN MatchEvents \n",
    "ON Matches.match_id = MatchEvents.match_id;\n",
    "\n",
    "To extend your SQL query and retrieve detailed information about matches from different seasons, including specific events, you can join multiple tables such as `Matches`, `MatchEvents`, and `Seasons`. Here’s how you can modify the query to include details like the season name:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Retrieve match date, season name, and event type\n",
    "SELECT Matches.date, Seasons.season, MatchEvents.event_type \n",
    "FROM Matches \n",
    "JOIN Seasons \n",
    "ON Matches.season_id = Seasons.season_id\n",
    "RIGHT JOIN MatchEvents \n",
    "ON Matches.match_id = MatchEvents.match_id;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "1. **`Matches.date`**: Fetches the date of the match.\n",
    "2. **`Seasons.season_name`**: Retrieves the name of the season from the `Seasons` table, joined via `season_id`.\n",
    "3. **`MatchEvents.event_type`**: Gets the type of event from the `MatchEvents` table.\n",
    "4. **`JOIN Seasons`**: Connects the `Matches` table with the `Seasons` table to include season information.\n",
    "5. **`RIGHT JOIN MatchEvents`**: Ensures that all events from the `MatchEvents` table are shown, even if there are no matches associated with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note\n",
    "- If your `Seasons` table does not have a `season_name` column, replace it with the appropriate column name.\n",
    "- This query brings in all records from the `MatchEvents` table and only matches from `Matches` that have events, including season information. If you need all matches regardless of events, you might want to switch to a `LEFT JOIN` instead."

    "## Simulating FULL JOIN\n",
    "\n",
    "Your new objective is to craft an SQL command to retrieve the match date and the match event type from the Matches and MatchEvents tables, respectively, while ensuring connectivity based on the match_id using a FULL JOIN. As MySQL does not support FULL JOIN directly, you will use a combination of LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN (include records that do not have matches in either table) and merge the results using UNION.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please fill in the blanks in the provided starter code by inputting the correct column names and join types to parallel what you've learned. Your focus is to simulate a FULL JOIN to ensure no data is missed out. Let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "-- TODO: Fetch match date and match event from Matches and MatchEvents tables\n",
    "SELECT _______._________, _______._______\n",
    "FROM Matches \n",
    "_______ JOIN MatchEvents \n",
    "ON Matches.match_id = MatchEvents.match_id;\n",
    "\n",
    "UNION\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT _______._________, _______._______\n",
    "FROM Matches \n",
    "_______ JOIN MatchEvents \n",
    "ON Matches.match_id = MatchEvents.match_id;\n",
    "\n",
    "To simulate a `FULL JOIN` in MySQL using a combination of `LEFT JOIN` and `RIGHT JOIN`, you can follow the pattern below. The idea is to use `UNION` to combine the results from a `LEFT JOIN` (all records from `Matches` and their corresponding events) and a `RIGHT JOIN` (all records from `MatchEvents` and their corresponding matches).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how you can complete the query:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Fetch match date and match event from Matches and MatchEvents tables using a simulated FULL JOIN\n",
    "SELECT Matches.date, MatchEvents.event_type\n",
    "FROM Matches \n",
    "LEFT JOIN MatchEvents \n",
    "ON Matches.match_id = MatchEvents.match_id\n",
    "\n",
    "UNION\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT Matches.date, MatchEvents.event_type\n",
    "FROM Matches \n",
    "RIGHT JOIN MatchEvents \n",
    "ON Matches.match_id = MatchEvents.match_id;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "1. **`LEFT JOIN`**: Retrieves all records from the `Matches` table and the matching records from `MatchEvents`. If no match is found, `event_type` will be `NULL`.\n",
    "2. **`RIGHT JOIN`**: Retrieves all records from the `MatchEvents` table and the matching records from `Matches`. If no match is found, `date` will be `NULL`.\n",
    "3. **`UNION`**: Combines the results of both queries, ensuring that all records from both tables are included.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures that you capture all possible matches and events, even if they don’t have a corresponding entry in the other table."
