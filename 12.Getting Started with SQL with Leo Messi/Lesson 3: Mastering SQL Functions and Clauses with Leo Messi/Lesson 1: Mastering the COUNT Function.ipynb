    "## Dataset Introduction\n",
    "In case you haven't done any of our other courses using this dataset, here is a quick overview for you. Below are some sample rows to give you an idea of the structure starting from the simplest table:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Matches Table\n",
    "| match_id | season_id | competition_id | matchday | date       | venue | club_id | opponent_id | result |\n",
    "|----------|-----------|----------------|----------|------------|-------|---------|-------------|--------|\n",
    "| 1        | 1         | 1              | 34       | 2005-01-05 | H     | 1       | 2           | 2:0    |\n",
    "| 2        | 2         | 2              | Group Stage | 2005-11-02 | H     | 1       | 2           | 5:0    |\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Matches** table contains all of Messi's matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "### MatchEvents Table\n",
    "| event_id | match_id | playing_position | minute | at_score | event_type        | goal_assist_id |\n",
    "|----------|----------|------------------|--------|----------|--------------------|-----------------|\n",
    "| 1        | 1        | CF               | 90+1   | 2:0      | Left-footed shot    | 1               |\n",
    "| 2        | 2        | RW               | 34     | 3:0      | Left-footed shot    | NULL            |\n",
    "\n",
    "The **MatchEvents** table lists Messi's match events (goals), linking them to their matches, and includes details about the playing position, minute, at-moment score, type of event, and reference to the player who assisted the goal.\n",

    "### Seasons Table\n",
    "| season_id | season | trophies_won |\n",

    "\n",
    "The **Seasons** table breaks down the trophies won in each season.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to COUNT Function\n",
    "The **COUNT** function in SQL is used to return the number of rows that match a specified condition. It can also be used without any condition to count all rows in a table. It is a simple yet powerful tool for performing quantitative analysis on data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Use Cases\n",
    "The **COUNT** function is commonly used in the following scenarios:\n",
    "- Counting the total number of rows in a table.\n",
    "- Counting the number of unique entries.\n",
    "- Counting the number of entries that satisfy a particular condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding how to use the **COUNT** function helps you derive quick summary statistics from your data, making it essential for tasks ranging from basic reporting to complex data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Syntax of the COUNT Function\n",
    "The basic syntax of the **COUNT** function in SQL is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT COUNT(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE condition;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break this down:\n",
    "- **SELECT:** The command used to retrieve data from the database.\n",
    "- **COUNT(column_name):** The COUNT function, which takes a column name as an argument.\n",
    "- **FROM table_name:** Specifies the table from which to retrieve the data.\n",
    "- **WHERE condition:** An optional clause to filter the rows counted.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you want to count all rows in a table without any condition, you can use the `*` symbol:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_name;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: Counting Total Rows in a Table\n",
    "Let's walk through an example to demonstrate how to count the total number of rows in a table. Recall the table named **Seasons** that stores information about different seasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "To count the total number of rows in the **Seasons** table, we use the following SQL query:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Seasons;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "COUNT(*)\n",
    "---------\n",
    "19\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "- **SELECT COUNT(*):** This command tells the database to count all rows.\n",
    "- **FROM Seasons:** This specifies the table from which to count the rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the **COUNT** function returns 19, which is the total number of rows in the **Seasons** table.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-world Application: Sports Analytics\n",
    "Counting rows in a table is not just a theoretical exercise; it has practical applications in real-world scenarios. For instance, in sports analytics, you might want to count how many seasons a player like Leo Messi's team won at least one trophy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a dataset that includes information about various players and the seasons they have played. Here, the **COUNT** function can help you quickly determine meaningful statistics related to specific players or teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we wanted to count the number of seasons for which Messi's team won at least one trophy, we would use the following query:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Seasons WHERE trophies_won > 0;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "COUNT(*)\n",
    "---------\n",
    "15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This query would count the total number of rows in the **Seasons** table where **trophies_won** is greater than 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary and Next Steps\n",
    "In this lesson, you learned:\n",
    "- The importance of SQL and quantitative analysis.\n",
    "- How the **COUNT** function works and its basic syntax.\n",
    "- How to use the **COUNT** function to count total rows in a table.\n",
    "- Practical applications of the **COUNT** function in sports analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you understand the **COUNT** function, you are ready to put this knowledge into practice. Proceed to the hands-on exercises to solidify your understanding and prepare for more advanced SQL topics in upcoming lessons. Happy querying!"
