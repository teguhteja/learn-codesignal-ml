By setting a threshold, we can determine what level of similarity is acceptable for considering two responses as equivalent. This method allows for more flexible and reliable evaluation of model responses.\n",

The script is structured to read the dataset, query the models, and evaluate their responses using fuzzy scoring. While the CodeSignal environment has the necessary libraries pre-installed, you should be aware of how to set up your environment on personal devices.

The script begins by defining a function `is_similar` that uses `SequenceMatcher` to determine the similarity between two strings.

If the similarity ratio exceeds the threshold, the function returns `True`, indicating that the strings are similar enough to be considered equivalent.\n",

We will incorporate few-shot learning by including a few examples in the prompts to improve the models' understanding and response accuracy.\n",
