                "Welcome back\\! In the previous lesson, we explored different prompting styles and their impact on the performance of large language models (LLMs) in question-answering (QA) tasks. We learned how zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting can influence the accuracy of model responses. As a reminder, these prompting styles help provide context to the model, which can significantly affect its ability to generate accurate answers.\n",
                "\n",
                "In this lesson, we will address a common challenge in evaluating QA systems: the limitations of exact match evaluation. Often, correct answers are not counted due to minor variations in wording or phrasing. For example, if the expected answer is \"New York City\" and the model responds with \"NYC,\" an exact match evaluation would mark this as incorrect, even though the response is valid. To overcome this, we will introduce the concept of **fuzzy matching**, which allows for more flexible and reliable evaluation by considering the similarity between responses.\n",

This tool compares two strings and returns a ratio indicating their similarity. A ratio closer to 1 means the strings are very similar, while a ratio closer to 0 indicates they are quite different. By setting a threshold, we can determine what level of similarity is acceptable for considering two responses as equivalent.\n",
