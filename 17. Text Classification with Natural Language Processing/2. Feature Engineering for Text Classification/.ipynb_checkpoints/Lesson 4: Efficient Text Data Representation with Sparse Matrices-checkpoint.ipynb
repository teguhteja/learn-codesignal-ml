    "# Lesson 4: Efficient Text Data Representation with Sparse Matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello and welcome to this lesson on \"Efficient Text Data Representation with Sparse Matrices\". As you recall, in our previous lessons, we transformed raw text data into numerical features, for example, using the Bag-of-Words (BoW) or Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) techniques. These transformation methods often create what we call \"Sparse Matrices,\" an incredibly memory-efficient way of storing high-dimensional data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break this down a bit. In the context of text data, each unique word across all documents could be treated as a distinct feature. However, each document will only include a small subset of these available features or unique words. Meaning, most entries in our feature matrix end up being 0s, hence resulting in a sparse matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll begin with a simple non-text matrix to illustrate sparse matrices and later connect this knowledge to our journey on text data transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "from scipy.sparse import csr_matrix, csc_matrix, coo_matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "# Simple example matrix\n",
    "vectors = np.array([\n",
    "    [0, 0, 2, 3, 0],\n",
    "    [4, 0, 0, 0, 6],\n",
    "    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n",
    "    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n",
    "    [0, 7, 0, 8, 0]\n",
    "])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sparse Matrix Formats: CSR\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll investigate how we can handle sparse matrices in different formats including: Compressed Sparse Row (CSR), Compressed Sparse Column (CSC), and the Coordinate (COO) formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start with the CSR format, a common format for sparse matrices that is excellent for quick arithmetic operations and matrix vector calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# CSR format\n",
    "sparse_csr = csr_matrix(vectors)\n",
    "print(\"Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) Matrix:\\n\", sparse_csr)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the above code will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) Matrix:\n",
    "   (0, 2)    2\n",
    "  (0, 3)    3\n",
    "  (1, 0)    4\n",
    "  (1, 4)    6\n",
    "  (4, 1)    7\n",
    "  (4, 3)    8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Observe that in the output of the Compressed Sparse Row representation, it records the values in the matrix row-wise, starting from the top. Each entry (0, 2), for example, tells us that the element in the 0th row and 2nd column is 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sparse Matrix Formats: CSC\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let's convert our vectors matrix to the CSC format. This format, like the CSR format, also forms the backbone of many operations we perform on sparse matrices. But it stores the non-zero entries column-wise, and is especially efficient for column slicing operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# CSC format\n",
    "sparse_csc = csc_matrix(vectors)\n",
    "print(\"Compressed Sparse Column (CSC) Matrix:\\n\", sparse_csc)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the above code will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Compressed Sparse Column (CSC) Matrix:\n",
    "   (1, 0)    4\n",
    "  (4, 1)    7\n",
    "  (0, 2)    2\n",
    "  (0, 3)    3\n",
    "  (4, 3)    8\n",
    "  (1, 4)    6\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Compressed Sparse Column output, the non-zero entries are stored column-wise. Essentially, CSC format is a transpose of the CSR format.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sparse Matrix Formats: COO\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, let's convert our example to the COO format or Coordinate List format. The COO format is another useful way to represent a sparse matrix and is simpler compared to CSR or CSC formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# COO format\n",
    "sparse_coo = coo_matrix(vectors)\n",
    "print(\"Coordinate Format (COO) Matrix:\\n\", sparse_coo)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the above code will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Coordinate Format (COO) Matrix:\n",
    "   (0, 2)    2\n",
    "  (0, 3)    3\n",
    "  (1, 0)    4\n",
    "  (1, 4)    6\n",
    "  (4, 1)    7\n",
    "  (4, 3)    8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the COO format, or Coordinate format, the non-zero entries are represented by their own coordinates (row, column). Unlike CSC or CSR, the COO format can contain duplicate entries. This can be particularly useful when data is being accumulated in several passes and there might be instances where duplicate entries are generated. These duplicates are not immediately merged in the COO format, providing you with flexibility for subsequent processing like duplicate resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Vectorized Operations: CSR and CSC\n",
    "\n",
    "Sparse matrices are not just memory-efficient storage mechanisms, but they also allow us to conduct operations directly on them. Specifically, the CSR and CSC formats support these operations directly, whereas the COO format requires converting back to CSR or CSC first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see this in practice when performing a multiplication operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Running operations on CSR and CSC matrices\n",
    "weighted_csr = sparse_csr.multiply(0.5)\n",
    "print(\"Weighted CSR:\\n\", weighted_csr.toarray())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the code block above will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Weighted CSR:\n",
    " [[0.  0.  1.  1.5 0. ]\n",
    " [2.  0.  0.  0.  3. ]\n",
    " [0.  3.5 0.  4.  0. ]\n",
    " [0.  0.  0.  0.  0. ]\n",
    " [0.  0.  0.  0.  0. ]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Vectorized Operations: COO\n",
    "\n",
    "And now let's demonstrate the process of performing the same multiplication operation on the COO format, but this time requiring conversion to CSR or CSC first.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Operation on COO requires conversion to CSR or CSC first\n",
    "weighted_coo = sparse_coo.tocsr().multiply(0.5)\n",
    "print(\"Weighted COO:\\n\", weighted_coo.toarray())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the above code will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Weighted COO:\n",
    " [[0.  0.  1.  1.5 0. ]\n",
    " [2.  0.  0.  0.  3. ]\n",
    " [0.  3.5 0.  4.  0. ]\n",
    " [0.  0.  0.  0.  0. ]\n",
    " [0.  0.  0.  0.  0. ]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Connection Between Sparse Matrices and NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "After going through the concepts and code, you might ask - what does all this have to do with NLP? Well, remember when we transformed raw text data into either a Bag-of-Words or a TF-IDF representation in the previous lessons? Each unique word across all documents was treated as a distinct feature. Given the high dimensionality and inherent sparsity of the resulting feature representation, we used sparse matrices for efficient storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling of sparse matrices becomes crucial in large NLP tasks, as they allow us to operate on large datasets while maintaining computational efficiency and optimal memory usage. Therefore, understanding these different formats of sparse matrices is an essential part of your feature engineering skills for text classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lesson Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! Today, you gained an insight into sparse matrices and their different formats, how they help efficiently storing and operating on high dimensional data like that of text records in NLP. You also explored the implications of implementing vectorized operations on different sparse matrix formats. Structuring your learning and understanding these formats is paramount to efficiently handle large datasets in NLP and other machine learning tasks. In the upcoming exercises, you'll get hands-on experience with these concepts, reinforcing your understanding further. Keep up the momentum and dive into practice!"

    "Great job, Stellar Navigator! Let's wrap things up. Given an array, convert it to Coordinate Format (COO) matrix, convert that to Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) format, and perform a Subtraction Operation on the non-zero elements. Finally, display the result. Get ready to teleport to success!\n",

    "### Revised Steps:\n",
    "1. **Convert to COO**: Start by converting the `array` into a COO matrix.\n",
    "2. **Convert to CSR**: Change the COO matrix to CSR format, which is more efficient for row slicing and operations.\n",
    "3. **Subtract from Non-zero Elements**: Directly modify the `data` attribute of the CSR matrix. This attribute holds the values of the non-zero elements, and by subtracting 2, we only affect these values, leaving the structure of zeros intact.\n",
    "4. **Convert Back to COO**: For easier viewing and verification, convert the modified CSR back to COO format.\n",
    "5. **Print the Result**: Display the resulting matrix, which now reflects the subtraction of 2 from each non-zero value.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures that only the non-zero values are modified, maintaining the efficiency and integrity of the sparse matrix representation."
