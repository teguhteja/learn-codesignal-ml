Introduction to Modeling Techniques for Text Classification
This course paves the way for your journey in NLP modeling. Delve deep into the world of text classification algorithms starting with Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, and Random Forests. But that's not all! You'll also get familiar with stratified cross-validation, a key tool for handling imbalanced classes in text data.
