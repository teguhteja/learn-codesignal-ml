    "# Lesson 1: Preprocessing Text Data: Train-Test Split and Stratified Cross-Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "# Topic Overview and Actualization\n",
    "\n",
    "Greetings in this segment of **Introduction to Modeling Techniques for Text Classification**! This part focuses on the heart of preprocessing techniques in modeling — **Train-Test Split** and **Stratified Cross-Validation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The foundation of any machine learning model is laid by creating an effective split in the dataset and ensuring class balance. You'll not only learn about these core concepts but also implement them using Python's powerful library, **scikit-learn**. Using these techniques, you'll split the SMS Spam Collection dataset for effective text classification later in the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "In real life, as you browse your inbox, you encounter various legitimate (ham) and promotional or unsolicited (spam) messages. Machine learning models help distinguish between these by labeling an incoming message as spam or ham. A good model is crucial for avoiding a cluttered inbox.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by loading the dataset. The datasets library can pull the data directly, and we'll convert it into a **pandas DataFrame** for easier data manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Import necessary libraries\n",
    "import datasets\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load the dataset\n",
    "spam_dataset = datasets.load_dataset('codesignal/sms-spam-collection', split='train')\n",
    "spam_dataset = pd.DataFrame(spam_dataset)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Display the first few rows of the dataset\n",
    "print(spam_dataset.head(3))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "  label                                            message\n",
    "0   ham  Go until jurong point, crazy.. Available only ...\n",
    "1   ham                      Ok lar... Joking wif u oni...\n",
    "2  spam  Free entry in 2 a wkly comp to win FA Cup fina...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This output displays the first three rows of the dataset, showcasing two ham messages and one spam message. Each message is labeled as either ham or spam under the 'label' column, indicating the class of each message.\n",
    "\n",
    "By running the above code blocks, you have loaded the SMS Spam Collection dataset — a collection of 5,572 text messages, each classified as either ham or spam, into a pandas DataFrame, a data structure ideal for data manipulation tasks. It's crucial to familiarize yourself with the dataset before further processing to provide a foundation for the preprocessing tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Diving into Train-Test Split\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start our journey of text classification, let's understand **Train-Test Split**. It is a method used to separate our dataset into two parts — a training set and a test set. The training set is what our machine learning model trains on, while the test set is used to evaluate the performance of our trained model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Split the Dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "Splitting the dataset prevents our model from overlearning the training data and ensures that it predicts unseen data robustly, improving model generalizability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's implement the train-test split on the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define X (input features) and Y (output labels)\n",
    "X = spam_dataset[\"message\"]\n",
    "Y = spam_dataset[\"label\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Perform the train-test split\n",
    "X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By specifying `test_size` as 0.2, we're splitting our data such that 80% goes to training, and the remaining 20% will be used for testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stratified Cross-Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "While any splitting would have worked, we choose **Stratified Cross-Validation** to ensure that both our training and testing datasets contain an equal representation of both spam and ham classes. This strategy is especially helpful when we have an imbalanced dataset, where one class heavily outnumbers the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's revise our train-test split and apply stratified cross-validation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Perform the train-test split using stratified cross-validation\n",
    "X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=Y)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that our data is prepared, let's validate our split:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Display the number of samples in training and test datasets\n",
    "print(f\"Training dataset: {len(X_train)} samples\")\n",
    "print(f\"Test dataset: {len(X_test)} samples\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Training dataset: 4459 samples\n",
    "Test dataset: 1115 samples\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This output confirms the successful split of our dataset into training and test datasets, with 4,459 samples allocated for training and 1,115 samples designated for testing, ensuring a balanced representation of classes in both sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lesson Summary and Practice Announcement\n",
    "\n",
    "Great work! You've now acquired a keen understanding of **train-test split** and **stratified cross-validation**, two fundamental data preprocessing techniques. As we delve into the next parts of the course, where we teach **Naive Bayes**, **SVMs**, **Decision Trees**, and **Random Forests** for text classification, this understanding will prove crucial. \n",
    "\n",
    "Do stick around for the practice exercises to reinforce these foundational concepts as you move on in your journey to becoming a proficient **Natural Language Processing Engineer**"

    "### Explanation of Each Section\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Loading the Dataset**:\n",
    "   - The dataset is loaded from the `datasets` library and transformed into a pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Defining Input Features and Output Labels**:\n",
    "   - `X` contains the messages, and `Y` contains the corresponding labels (spam or ham).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Performing the Train-Test Split**:\n",
    "   - The dataset is split into training and testing sets, with 20% of the data reserved for testing. The `stratify=Y` parameter ensures that the class distribution is maintained in both sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calculating Class Distribution**:\n",
    "   - The class distribution in both the training and test sets is calculated using `value_counts(normalize=True)`, which returns the proportion of each class. Multiplying by 100 converts it to a percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Output\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run this code, you should see output similar to the following, indicating the distribution of classification labels in both the training and test datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Class distribution in the training set:\n",
    "ham     82.3\n",
    "spam    17.7\n",
    "Name: label, dtype: float64\n",
    "\n",
    "Class distribution in the test set:\n",
    "ham     82.3\n",
    "spam    17.7\n",
    "Name: label, dtype: float64\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This output confirms that the stratified split has been successfully executed, maintaining the class distribution in both the training and test datasets."
