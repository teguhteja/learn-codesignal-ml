    "# **Lesson Overview**  \n",
    "Today, we will explore **Logistic Regression**‚Äîa powerful and efficient machine learning algorithm for **binary classification tasks**, especially in **text classification**. Our goal is to understand the principles of Logistic Regression, build a model to classify text messages, and evaluate its performance. Let‚Äôs get started!  \n",

    "## **1. Introduction to Logistic Regression**  \n",
    "**Logistic Regression** is a statistical method used for **binary classification problems**. Unlike **Linear Regression**, which predicts continuous output, Logistic Regression is designed to **predict the probability of a class or event** within a range of **0 to 1**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Use Logistic Regression?**  \n",
    "‚úÖ Efficient and requires minimal computational resources  \n",
    "‚úÖ Easy to implement and highly **interpretable**  \n",
    "‚úÖ Well-suited for **binary classification** (e.g., detecting spam emails)  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Limitations of Logistic Regression**  \n",
    "‚ùå Cannot handle **non-linear** problems, as it has a **linear decision boundary**  \n",
