    "# Lesson 3: Mastering Support Vector Machines for Effective Text Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Brief Introduction to Support Vector Machines (SVM)\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)** are classification algorithms used to label data into different classes. The SVM algorithm segregates data into two groups by finding a **hyperplane** in a high-dimensional space (or surface, in the case of more than two features) that distinctly classifies the data points. The algorithm chooses the hyperplane that represents the largest separation, or **margin**, between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "SVM is extremely useful for solving nonlinear text classification problems. It can efficiently perform non-linear classification using the **kernel trick**, which implicitly maps the inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SVM's Distinguishing Factors\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hyperplanes**: Decision boundaries that help SVM separate data into different classes.\n",
    "- **Support Vectors**: Data points that lie closest to the decision surface (or hyperplane). They are critical because they help maximize the margin of the classifier.\n",
    "- **Kernel Trick**: Allows SVM to handle non-linear input spaces by mapping them into a higher-dimensional space.\n",
    "- **Soft Margin**: Enables SVM to allow some misclassifications in its model for better performance, introducing flexibility through the concept of a soft margin.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Loading and Preprocessing the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This section revisits code familiar to you, focusing on loading and preprocessing the SMS Spam Collection dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Import the necessary libraries\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\n",
    "from sklearn import metrics\n",
    "from sklearn.svm import SVC\n",
    "from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n",
    "import datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load the dataset\n",
    "spam_dataset = datasets.load_dataset('codesignal/sms-spam-collection', split='train')\n",
    "spam_dataset = pd.DataFrame(spam_dataset)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define X (input features) and Y (output labels)\n",
    "X = spam_dataset[\"message\"]\n",

    "\n",
    "# Transform the test data\n",
    "X_test_count = count_vectorizer.transform(X_test)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementing Support Vector Machines for Text Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's delve into the practical implementation of SVM for text classification using the Scikit-learn library. We introduce the `SVC()` function, which is used to fit the SVM model according to the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Initialize the SVC model\n",
    "svm_model = SVC()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fit the model on the training data\n",
    "svm_model.fit(X_train_count, Y_train)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Make predictions on the test data\n",
    "y_pred = svm_model.predict(X_test_count)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Parameters of SVC:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **C**: Penalty parameter of the error term. It controls the trade-off between a smooth decision boundary and correctly classifying training points.\n",
    "- **kernel**: Specifies the kernel type to be used in the algorithm. Options include `'linear'`, `'poly'`, `'rbf'`, `'sigmoid'`, `'precomputed'`, or a callable.\n",
    "- **degree**: Degree of the polynomial kernel function (`'poly'`). Ignored by all other kernels.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Making Predictions and Evaluating the SVM Model\n",
    "\n",
    "After building the model, the next step is to use it on unseen data and evaluate its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Make predictions on the test data\n",
    "y_pred = svm_model.predict(X_test_count)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calculate the accuracy of the model\n",
    "accuracy = metrics.accuracy_score(Y_test, y_pred)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the accuracy\n",
    "print(f\"Accuracy of Support Vector Machines Classifier: {accuracy:.2f}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Accuracy of Support Vector Machines Classifier: 0.98\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This output signifies that the SVM model has achieved a high accuracy of **98%** in classifying messages as spam or ham, highlighting its effectiveness in text classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lesson Summary and Upcoming Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations on completing this lesson! You have learned the theory behind Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and how to use them for text classification in Python. Specifically, you've learned to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load and preprocess data\n",
    "- Build an SVM model\n",
    "- Evaluate the model's accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, like any skill, programming requires practice. The upcoming practice exercises will help reinforce the knowledge you've acquired in this lesson, providing further expertise in SVM and text classification. Good luck! You're doing a great job, and I look forward to seeing you in the next lesson on **Decision Trees for text classification**."

    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **`svm_model.predict(X_test_count)`**: Uses the trained SVM model to make predictions on the transformed test data (`X_test_count`).\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Steps to Run the Completed Code\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ensure All Required Libraries Are Installed**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Before running the script, make sure that all the necessary libraries are installed. Specifically, the `datasets` library from Hugging Face might not be installed by default. You can install it using `pip`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    pip install datasets\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    If you encounter any issues with the `datasets` library or prefer not to use it, you can alternatively load your dataset using `pandas` directly if you have the dataset available locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Execute the Script**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Run the Python script in your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, or the command line).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expected Output\n",
    "\n",
    "After successfully running the completed script, you should see an output similar to the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Accuracy of Support Vector Machines Classifier with linear kernel: 0.98\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The actual accuracy may vary based on the dataset's characteristics and the specific preprocessing steps applied. An accuracy of **98%** indicates that the SVM model is highly effective in classifying messages as spam or ham.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Troubleshooting Common Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'datasets'**\n",
    "\n",
    "    If you encounter the following error:\n",
    "\n",

    "    ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'datasets'\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Solution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Ensure that the `datasets` library is installed. Install it using `pip`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    pip install datasets\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    Alternatively, if you prefer not to use the `datasets` library, you can load the dataset using `pandas` from a CSV file or another source.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Alternative Dataset Loading with Pandas**\n",
    "\n",
    "    If you have the SMS Spam Collection dataset locally (e.g., as a CSV file), you can load it using `pandas` as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # Load the dataset from a CSV file\n",
    "    spam_dataset = pd.read_csv('path_to_your_dataset.csv', encoding='latin-1')\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Assuming the CSV has columns 'label' and 'message'\n",
    "    X = spam_dataset[\"message\"]\n",
    "    Y = spam_dataset[\"label\"]\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    Replace `'path_to_your_dataset.csv'` with the actual path to your dataset file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "With your SVM model now trained and evaluated, here are some suggestions for further exploration:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Experiment with Different Kernels:** Try using other kernel types such as `'poly'`, `'rbf'`, or `'sigmoid'` to see how they affect the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Adjust parameters like `C`, `degree` (for polynomial kernel), and `gamma` (for RBF kernel) to optimize the model's accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cross-Validation:** Implement cross-validation to get a more robust estimate of the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feature Engineering:** Explore different text preprocessing techniques, such as TF-IDF vectorization, to enhance model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep up the great work! You're well on your way to mastering Support Vector Machines for text classification. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Happy coding!"

    "   - The SMS Spam Collection dataset is loaded directly from a GitHub repository using `pandas.read_csv`.\n",
    "   - The dataset is tab-separated (`sep='\\t'`) and lacks a header, so we manually assign column names: `'label'` and `'message'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Exploration:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Display the first five entries to understand the structure of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Defining Features and Labels:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - `X`: Contains the SMS messages.\n",
    "   - `Y`: Contains the corresponding labels (`'spam'` or `'ham'`).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Train-Test Split:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - The dataset is split into training and testing sets with an 80-20 ratio.\n",
    "   - **Stratification** ensures that the proportion of classes (`'spam'` and `'ham'`) remains consistent across both sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Text Vectorization:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - `CountVectorizer` converts the text data into numerical data by counting the frequency of each word in the messages.\n",
    "   - The vectorizer is **fitted** on the training data and then **transforms** both training and testing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Initializing and Training the SVM Model:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - An SVM classifier with a **linear kernel** is initialized.\n",
    "   - The model is trained using the vectorized training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Making Predictions:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - The trained model predicts labels for the test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Evaluating the Model:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Accuracy Score**: Proportion of correctly classified instances.\n",
    "   - **Classification Report**: Detailed metrics including precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.\n",
    "   - **Confusion Matrix**: Shows the number of correct and incorrect predictions made by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Visualizing the Results:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - A bar chart displays the number of correct and incorrect predictions made by the model.\n",

    "#### **Troubleshooting Common Issues**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'datasets'**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Cause:** The script initially attempted to use the `datasets` library, which wasn't installed.\n",
    "   - **Solution:** The revised script eliminates the need for the `datasets` library by loading the dataset directly using `pandas`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Network Issues While Loading the Dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Cause:** The script fetches the dataset from an external URL. If there's a network issue, loading will fail.\n",
    "   - **Solution:** \n",
    "     - **Check Internet Connection:** Ensure you have a stable internet connection.\n",
    "     - **Alternative Data Source:** Download the dataset manually from [UCI Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection) and load it locally.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     **Example of Loading a Local Dataset:**\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     # Replace 'path_to_your_dataset.csv' with your local file path\n",
    "     spam_dataset = pd.read_csv('path_to_your_dataset.csv', sep='\\t', header=None, names=['label', 'message'])\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Memory Errors with Very Large Datasets**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Cause:** Extremely large datasets might cause memory issues during processing.\n",
    "   - **Solution:** \n",
    "     - **Use a Subset of the Data:** For practice purposes, you can work with a smaller subset.\n",
    "       ```python\n",
    "       spam_dataset = spam_dataset.sample(n=1000, random_state=42)\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "     - **Optimize Vectorization:** Limit the number of features in `CountVectorizer`.\n",
    "       ```python\n",
    "       count_vectorizer = CountVectorizer(max_features=5000)\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Next Steps and Enhancements**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Experiment with Different Kernels:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Try using other kernel types such as `'poly'`, `'rbf'`, or `'sigmoid'` by changing the `kernel` parameter in `SVC`.\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     svm_model = SVC(kernel='rbf')\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Adjust parameters like `C`, `degree` (for polynomial kernel), and `gamma` (for RBF kernel) to optimize model performance.\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     svm_model = SVC(kernel='linear', C=1.0, gamma='scale')\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use TF-IDF Vectorization:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Replace `CountVectorizer` with `TfidfVectorizer` to consider the importance of words.\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\n",
    "     tfidf_vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()\n",
    "     X_train_tfidf = tfidf_vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)\n",
    "     X_test_tfidf = tfidf_vectorizer.transform(X_test)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Implement Cross-Validation:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Use cross-validation to obtain a more reliable estimate of the model's performance.\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\n",
    "     scores = cross_val_score(svm_model, X_train_count, Y_train, cv=5)\n",
    "     print(f\"Cross-Validation Accuracy Scores: {scores}\")\n",
    "     print(f\"Mean Cross-Validation Accuracy: {scores.mean():.2f}\")\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Explore Feature Engineering:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Incorporate n-grams, remove stop words, or apply stemming/lemmatization to enhance feature quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Address Class Imbalance:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - The dataset may have an imbalance between `spam` and `ham` messages. Techniques like **SMOTE** or adjusting the `class_weight` parameter can help.\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     svm_model = SVC(kernel='linear', class_weight='balanced')\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Deploy the Model:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Once satisfied with the model's performance, consider deploying it as a web service or integrating it into applications for real-time spam detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Conclusion**\n",
