    "# Lesson 4: Text Preprocessing for Deep Learning with TensorFlow\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome, data enthusiasts! In this lesson, we will continue our journey into the world of Natural Language Processing (NLP), with an introduction to deep learning for text classification. To harness the power of deep learning, it's important to start with proper data preparation. That's why we will focus today on text preprocessing, shifting from Scikit-learn, which we used previously in this course, to the powerful TensorFlow library.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this lesson is to leverage TensorFlow for textual data preparation and understand how it differs from the methods we used earlier. We will implement tokenization, convert tokens into sequences, learn how to pad these sequences to a consistent length, and transform categorical labels into integer labels to input into our deep learning model. Let's dive in!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding TensorFlow and its Role in Text Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow is an open-source library developed by Google, encompassing a comprehensive ecosystem of tools, libraries, and resources that facilitate machine learning and deep learning tasks, including NLP. As with any machine learning task, preprocessing of your data is a key step in NLP as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "A significant difference between text preprocessing with TensorFlow and using libraries like Scikit-learn lies in the approach to tokenization and sequence generation. TensorFlow incorporates a highly efficient tokenization process, handling both tokenization and sequence generation within the same library. Let's understand how this process works.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tokenizing Text Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Tokenization is a foundational step in NLP, where sentences or texts are segmented into individual words or tokens. This process facilitates the comprehension of the language structure and produces meaningful units of text that serve as input for numerous machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "In TensorFlow, we utilize the `Tokenizer` class for tokenization. A unique feature of TensorFlow's tokenizer is its robust handling of 'out-of-vocabulary' (OOV) words, or words not present in the tokenizer's word index. By specifying the `oov_token` parameter, we can assign a special token, `<OOV>`, to represent these OOV words.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of Tokenization:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer\n",
    "\n",
    "sentence = \"Love is a powerful entity.\"\n",
    "tokenizer = Tokenizer(num_words=100, oov_token=\"<OOV>\")\n",
    "tokenizer.fit_on_texts([sentence])\n",
    "word_index = tokenizer.word_index\n",
    "print(word_index)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "{'<OOV>': 1, 'love': 2, 'is': 3, 'a': 4, 'powerful': 5, 'entity': 6}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this mechanism, TensorFlow's `Tokenizer` effectively prepares text data for subsequent machine learning tasks by mapping words to consistent integer values while gracefully handling words not encountered during the initial vocabulary construction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Converting Text to Sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "After tokenization, the next step is to represent text as sequences of integers. Sequences are lists of integers where each integer corresponds to a token in the dictionary created during tokenization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of Converting Text to Sequences:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sentences = [sentence, \"very powerful\"]\n",
    "sequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(sentences)\n",
    "print(sequences)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "[[2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [1, 5]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The word “very” is not found in the tokenizer's word index, thus it is labeled as token `1`, which we designated as the `<OOV>` token. The word “powerful”, being recognized in the vocabulary, retains its assigned index `5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Padding Sequences for Consistent Input Shape\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning models require input data of a consistent shape. Padding ensures this by adding zeros to shorter sequences to match the length of the longest sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of Padding Sequences:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "padded_sequences = pad_sequences(sequences, padding='post')\n",
    "print(padded_sequences)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "[[2 3 4 5 6]\n",
    " [1 5 0 0 0]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The padding ensures all sequences are unified in length, catering to the requirements of deep learning models for consistent input shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementing Text Preprocessing with TensorFlow\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, let's implement the entire preprocessing workflow with a limited set of data from the Reuters-21578 text categorization dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Full Implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer\n",
    "from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences\n",

    "print(\"Shape of X: \", X.shape)\n",
    "print(\"Shape of Y: \", y.shape)\n",
    "```\n",

    "Updated sequence: [[2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, tokenizer.fit_on_texts([...]) examines the text it receives and constructs a vocabulary from the unique words found within, but now with a restriction of num_words=5.
