    "# Lesson 3: Removing Stop Words and Stemming in Text Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello and welcome to this lesson on **Removing Stop Words and Stemming**! In this lesson, we will dive deep into two essential steps for preparing text data for machine learning models: removing stop words and stemming. These techniques will help us improve the efficiency and accuracy of our models. Let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding Stop Words\n",
    "\n",
    "In Natural Language Processing (NLP), **stop words** refer to the most common words in a language that do not provide significant meaning. Examples include \"and\", \"the\", \"is\", and others. These words are often removed to speed up processing without losing crucial information. Python's Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) provides a pre-defined list of stop words. Let's take a look:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from nltk.corpus import stopwords\n",
    "\n",
    "# Defining the stop words\n",
    "stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print 5 stop words\n",
    "examples_of_stopwords = list(stop_words)[:5]\n",
    "print(f\"Examples of stop words: {examples_of_stopwords}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the above code will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Examples of stop words: ['or', 'some', 'couldn', 'hasn', 'after']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the `stopwords.words('english')` function returns a list of English stop words. You might sometimes need to add domain-specific stop words to this list based on the nature of your text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Stemming\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stemming** is a technique that reduces a word to its root form. Although the stemmed word may not always be a real or grammatically correct word in English, it helps consolidate different forms of the same word into a common base form, reducing the complexity of text data. This simplification leads to quicker computation and potentially better performance when implementing NLP algorithms, as there are fewer unique words to consider.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the words \"run\", \"runs\", and \"running\" might all be stemmed to the common root \"run\". This helps our algorithm understand that these words are related and carry a similar semantic meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's illustrate this with the **Porter Stemmer**, a well-known stemming algorithm from the NLTK library:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer\n",
    "\n",
    "# Stemming with NLTK Porter Stemmer\n",
    "stemmer = PorterStemmer()\n",
    "\n",
    "stemmed_word = stemmer.stem('running')\n",
    "print(f\"Stemmed word: {stemmed_word}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the above code will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Stemmed word: run\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `PorterStemmer` class comes with the `stem` method that takes in a word and returns its root form. In this case, \"running\" is correctly stemmed to its root word \"run\". This form of preprocessing, although it may lead to words that are not recognizable, is a standard practice in text preprocessing for NLP tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stop Words Removal and Stemming in Action\n",
    "\n",
    "Having understood stop words and stemming, let's develop a function that removes stop words and applies stemming to a given text. We will tokenize the text (split it into individual words) and apply these transformations word by word.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\n",
    "\n",
    "def remove_stopwords_and_stem(text):\n",
    "    tokenized_text = word_tokenize(text)\n",
    "    filtered_text = [stemmer.stem(word) for word in tokenized_text if word not in stop_words]\n",
    "    return \" \".join(filtered_text)\n",
    "\n",
    "example_text = \"This is an example text to demonstrate the removal of stop words and stemming.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"Original Text: {example_text}\")\n",
    "print(f\"Processed Text: {remove_stopwords_and_stem(example_text)}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the above code will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Original Text: This is an example text to demonstrate the removal of stop words and stemming.\n",
    "Processed Text: thi exampl text demonstr remov stop word stem .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `remove_stopwords_and_stem` function performs the required processing and provides the cleaned-up text.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stop Words Removal and Stemming on a Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's implement the above concepts on a real-world text dataset – the **20 Newsgroups Dataset**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fetching 20 newsgroups dataset\n",
    "newsgroups_data = fetch_20newsgroups(subset='all')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Limit to first 100 data points for efficient code execution\n",
    "newsgroups_data = newsgroups_data['data'][:100]\n",
    "\n",
    "processed_newsgroups_data = [remove_stopwords_and_stem(text) for text in newsgroups_data]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print first 100 characters of the first document\n",
    "print(\"First 100 characters of the first processed document:\")\n",
    "print(processed_newsgroups_data[0][:100])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the above code will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "First 100 characters of the first processed document:\n",
    "from : mamatha devineni ratnam < mr47+ @ andrew.cmu.edu > subject : pen fan reaction organ : post of\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This process can take a while for large datasets, but the output will be much cleaner and easier for a machine learning model to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary and Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "And that's a wrap! In today's lesson, we've learned about stop words and stemming as crucial steps in text preprocessing for machine learning models. We used Python's NLTK library to work with stop words and perform stemming. We processed some example sentences and a real-world dataset to practice these concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we proceed to more advanced NLP tasks, preprocessing techniques like removing stop words and stemming will serve as a solid foundation. In the upcoming lessons, we will delve deeper into handling missing text data and learn about reshaping textual data for analysis. Let's keep going!"

    "To modify the provided code by replacing the `LancasterStemmer` with `PorterStemmer`, you will need to import `PorterStemmer` from `nltk.stem` and create an instance of it. Below is the adjusted code:\n",

    "Processed Text: exampl text demonstr remov stop word stem .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Differences in Processed Text:\n",
    "The main difference you might observe between the outputs of `LancasterStemmer` and `PorterStemmer` is in how they handle certain words. The Porter Stemmer is generally more conservative and may produce different stemmed forms compared to the Lancaster Stemmer, which is more aggressive in its stemming approach. \n",

    "### Explanation of the Code:\n",
    "1. **Stop Words and Stemmer Initialization**:\n",
    "   - `stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))`: This line defines a set of English stop words using NLTK's predefined list.\n",
    "   - `stemmer = PorterStemmer()`: This line creates an instance of the `PorterStemmer`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Text Cleaning Function**:\n",
    "   - The `clean_text` function processes the input text by converting it to lowercase, removing email addresses, URLs, punctuation, digits, and extra spaces. Finally, it calls `remove_stopwords_and_stem` to further process the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Stop Words Removal and Stemming Function**:\n",
    "   - The `remove_stopwords_and_stem` function tokenizes the cleaned text, removes stop words, applies stemming to the remaining words, and returns the processed text as a single string.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Fetching and Processing Newsgroup Data**:\n",
    "   - The code fetches the first article from the 20 Newsgroups dataset and processes it using the `clean_text` function. The cleaned article is then printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Output:\n",
    "When you run the completed code, you should see the first newsgroup article printed after cleaning and preprocessing. The output will show the text with stop words removed and words stemmed, making it more suitable for further analysis or modeling. \n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you have the necessary NLTK resources downloaded, especially the stop words and punkt tokenizer. If you encounter any errors related to missing resources, you can download them using:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import nltk\n",
    "nltk.download('stopwords')\n",
    "nltk.download('punkt')\n",
    "```"
