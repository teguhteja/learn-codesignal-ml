    "# Lesson 4: Unleashing the Power of n-grams in Text Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "# Topic Overview and Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello, and welcome to today's lesson on n-grams! If you've ever wondered how language models or text classifiers can understand the context or sequence in text, it's usually courtesy of our today's hero â€” n-grams. In this lesson, we'll delve into the magic of n-grams and their essential role in processing textual data. Specifically, we'll learn how to create n-grams from text data using Python, covering unigrams and bigrams.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are n-grams?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Natural Language Processing, analyzing text often benefits from considering not only individual words but also sequences of words. This approach helps to grasp the context better. Here is where n-grams come in handy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: An n-gram is a contiguous sequence of n items from a given sample of text or speech. The 'n' stands for the number of words in the sequence.\n",
    "  - For instance, in \"I love dogs\":\n",
    "    - A 1-gram (or unigram) is just one word, like \"love.\"\n",
    "    - A 2-gram (or bigram) would be a sequence of 2 words, like \"I love\" or \"love dogs.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "N-grams help preserve the sequential information or context in text data, contributing significantly to many language models or text classifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preparing Data for n-Grams Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can create n-grams, we need clean, structured text data. The text must be cleaned and preprocessed into a desirable format, after which it can be used for feature extraction or modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cleaning Text\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a familiar code snippet that applies cleaning to our text, removing stop words and stemming the remaining words. These steps include lower-casing words, removing punctuation, useless words (stopwords), and reducing all words to their base or stemmed form.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Function to clean text and perform stemming\n",
    "def clean_text(text):\n",
    "    text = text.lower()  # Convert text to lower case\n",
    "    text = re.sub(r'\\S*@\\S*\\s?', '', text)  # Remove email addresses\n",
    "    text = re.sub(r'http\\S+', '', text)  # Remove URLs\n",
    "    text = re.sub(r'\\W', ' ', text)  # Remove punctuation and special characters\n",
    "    text = re.sub(r'\\d', ' ', text)  # Remove digits\n",
    "    text = re.sub(r'\\s\\s+', ' ', text)  # Remove extra spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "    tokenized_text = word_tokenize(text)\n",
    "    filtered_text = [stemmer.stem(word) for word in tokenized_text if not word in stop_words]\n",
    "\n",
    "    return \" \".join(filtered_text)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating n-grams with Python: Setting up the Vectorizer\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's `sklearn` library provides an accessible way to generate n-grams. The `CountVectorizer` class in the `sklearn.feature_extraction.text` module can convert a given text into its matrix representation and allows us to specify the type of n-grams we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting Up the Vectorizer\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's set up our vectorizer as a preliminary step towards creating n-grams:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\n",
    "vectorizer = CountVectorizer(ngram_range=(1, 2))  # Generate unigram and bigram\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ngram_range=(1, 2)` parameter instructs our vectorizer to generate n-grams where n ranges from 1 to 2. So, the `CountVectorizer` will generate both unigrams and bigrams. If we wanted unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams, we could use `ngram_range=(1, 3)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating n-grams with Python: Applying the Vectorizer\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've set up our n-gram generating machine, let's use it on some real-world data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fetching and Cleaning Data\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Fetching 20 newsgroups dataset and restricting to first 100 records for performance\n",
    "newsgroups_data = fetch_20newsgroups(subset='all')['data'][:100]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Clean and preprocess the newsgroup data\n",
    "cleaned_data = [clean_text(data) for data in newsgroups_data]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applying the Vectorizer\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying the vectorizer to our cleaned text data will create the n-grams:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Apply the CountVectorizer on the cleaned data to create n-grams\n",
    "X = vectorizer.fit_transform(cleaned_data)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Display the shape of X\n",
    "print(\"Shape of X with n-grams: \", X.shape)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the total number of features\n",
    "features = vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()\n",
    "print(\"Total number of features: \", len(features))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print features from index 100 to 110\n",
    "print(\"Features from index 100 to 110: \", features[100:111])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the above code will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Shape of X with n-grams**: (100, 16246)\n",
    "- **Total number of features**: 16246\n",
    "- **Features from index 100 to 110**: `['accid figur', 'accid worri', 'accomod', 'accomod like', 'accord', 'accord document', 'accord lynn', 'accord mujanov', 'accord previou', 'account', 'account curiou']`\n",
    "\n",
    "The shape of X is (100, 16246), indicating we have a high-dimensional feature space. The first number, 100, represents the number of documents or records in your dataset (limited to the first 100 records), while 16246 represents the unique n-grams or features created from all the documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "By printing `features[100:111]`, we get a glimpse into our features, where each string represents an n-gram from our cleaned text data. The returned n-grams include both unigrams (single words) and bigrams (two-word phrases).\n",
    "\n",
    "Generating n-grams adds a new level of complexity to our analysis, as we now have multiple types of features or tokens. You can experiment with the `ngram_range` parameter in `CountVectorizer` to include trigrams or higher-level n-grams, depending on your specific context and requirements. Remember, each choice will have implications for the complexity and interpretability of your models, and it's always a balance between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lesson Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations, you've finished today's lesson on n-grams! We've explored what n-grams are and their importance in text classification. We then moved on to preparing data for creating n-grams before diving into generating them using Python's `CountVectorizer` class in the `sklearn` library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, it's time to get hands-on. Try generating trigrams or 4-grams from the same cleaned newsgroups data and notice the differences. Practicing these skills will not only reinforce the concepts learned in this lesson but also enable you to understand when and how much context is needed for certain tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "As always, happy learning!\n"

    "### Expected Output\n",
