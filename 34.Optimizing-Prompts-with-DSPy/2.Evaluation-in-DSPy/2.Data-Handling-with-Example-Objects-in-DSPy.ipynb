Data handling is a crucial step in any machine learning workflow, and DSPy provides a powerful yet simple way to manage your data through **Example** objects. These objects are used to represent data items in both training and test sets, allowing you to efficiently organize and manipulate your data. By the end of this lesson, you will be equipped with the skills to create and manage **Example** objects, setting a strong foundation for your journey in DSPy.\n",

                "Let's begin by introducing the `dspy.Example` class, which is central to data handling in DSPy. An **Example** object is similar to a Python dictionary but comes with additional utilities that make it particularly useful for machine learning tasks. To create a basic example object, you can use the following code:\n",

                "In this example, we create an **Example** object named `qa_pair` with two fields: `question` and `answer`. The `print` statements allow us to view the entire object as well as access individual fields. The output of this code will be:\n",
