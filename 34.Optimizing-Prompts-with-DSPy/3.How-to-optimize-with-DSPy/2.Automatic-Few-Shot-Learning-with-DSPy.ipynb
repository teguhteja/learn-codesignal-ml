                "1.  **The Metric Function** (`tweet_metric`): This is the heart of `BootstrapFewShot`. The optimizer uses this function to determine if a self-generated example (a topic, an LLM-generated tweet) is good enough to be included in the final, optimized prompt. We defined criteria like having a **hashtag** and being **on-topic**.\n",
                "2.  **Compilation Process**: When `compile()` is called, the `BootstrapFewShot` optimizer:\n",
                "      * Takes the `trainset` examples.\n",
                "      * Uses the original `tweet_program` (the \"teacher\") to generate a tweet for each example in the trainset.\n",
                "      * **Applies the `tweet_metric`** to the generated examples.\n",
                "      * Saves the examples that pass the metric check (the \"bootstrapped demos\").\n",
                "      * The final compiled program then uses these high-quality, *self-generated* examples in its prompt when answering new questions.\n",
                "3.  **Parameters**: `max_errors=2` ensures the bootstrapping process stops quickly if the model is having trouble generating high-quality demos, saving time and cost. `max_bootstrapped_demos=4` limits the number of generated examples to avoid prompt clutter."
