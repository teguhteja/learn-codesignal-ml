                "1.  **Escaping Special Characters**: In regular expressions, curly braces (`{` and `}`) are special characters used for quantifiers (e.g., `{3}` means \"three times\"). Since we want to match the literal placeholder string `{{input}}`, we must escape the braces using double backslashes (`\\\\`) in a standard string, or a single backslash (`\\`) in a **raw string** (`r\"...\"`), which is the common practice here: `r\"\\{\\{input\\}\\}\"`.\n",
                "2.  **`re.compile()`**: Compiling the pattern first makes the substitution operation slightly more efficient, especially if the function is called repeatedly.\n",
                "3.  **`pattern.sub(str(input_value), template_str)`**: This method performs the actual replacement. It finds **all** non-overlapping occurrences of the pattern in `template_str` and replaces them with the string representation of `input_value`. This handles the requirement to replace **all instances** dynamically\\!"
