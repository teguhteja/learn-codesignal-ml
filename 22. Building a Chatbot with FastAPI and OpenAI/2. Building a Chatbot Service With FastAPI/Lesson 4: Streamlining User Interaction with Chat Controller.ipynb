Now, we will focus on the `ChatController`, a crucial component that manages chat sessions and handles messages by interacting with both the model and service layers. The controller is responsible for orchestrating the flow of data between the user interface and the backend services, ensuring that user interactions are processed efficiently and effectively.\n",
