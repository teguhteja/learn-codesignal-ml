Now, we will take the next step in our journey by building the **Chat Service Layer**. This layer is essential for integrating the language model with chat sessions, allowing us to process user messages and generate AI responses. By the end of this lesson, you will understand how to set up the `ChatService` class, create chat sessions, and process messages using OpenAI’s API.\n",
