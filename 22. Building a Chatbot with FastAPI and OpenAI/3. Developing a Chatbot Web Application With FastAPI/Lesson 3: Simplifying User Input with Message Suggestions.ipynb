This allowed for real-time communication between the user and the server, enhancing the interactivity of our application. Today, we will build on that foundation by adding **message suggestions** to our chat interface. Message suggestions are predefined prompts that users can select to quickly send common queries. This feature not only improves user experience by making interactions more efficient but also guides users in formulating their questions.\n",
