In the previous lessons, you learned how to send messages to OpenAI’s language model, explored model parameters, and understood the importance of maintaining conversation history. Now, we will focus on **personalizing your AI by using system prompts**. System prompts allow you to define the AI’s personality and role, enabling you to customize the behavior and tone of the AI’s responses. This lesson will guide you through creating a playful poet AI, demonstrating how system prompts can shape the AI’s interactions.\n",
