In a chatbot interaction, messages are typically categorized by roles officially recognized by OpenAI: \"system\", \"user\", and \"assistant\". While we’ll explore system prompts more thoroughly in a later lesson, remember that these primary roles help define the flow of dialogue and ensure the AI understands who is speaking at any given time. You can technically specify other roles, but doing so may produce unpredictable results because they are not officially supported by OpenAI’s chat completion API.\n",
