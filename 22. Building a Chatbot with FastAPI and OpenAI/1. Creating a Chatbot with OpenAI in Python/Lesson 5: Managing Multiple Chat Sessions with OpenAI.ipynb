In the previous lessons, you learned how to send messages to OpenAI's language model, explored model parameters, maintained conversation history, and personalized AI behavior with system prompts. Now, we will focus on **managing multiple chat sessions**. This is crucial for applications where you need to handle several conversations simultaneously, such as customer service chatbots. By the end of this lesson, you will be able to create and manage multiple chat sessions using OpenAI’s API, setting the stage for more complex interactions.\n",
