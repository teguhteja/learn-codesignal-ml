The process involves defining a grid of hyperparameters and then evaluating model performance for each point in the grid. While using cross-validation to evaluate this performance is not mandatory, it is highly recommended. Cross-validation ensures that the evaluation is performed on multiple splits of the data, providing a more reliable performance estimate. We can visualize this process as searching over a multi-dimensional space, where each dimension is a different hyperparameter and we want to find the point (or points) in this space that have the highest accuracy or the lowest loss.\n",
