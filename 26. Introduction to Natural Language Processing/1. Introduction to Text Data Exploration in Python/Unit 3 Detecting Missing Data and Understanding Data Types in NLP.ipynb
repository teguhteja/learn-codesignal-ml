In this lesson, we'll continue using the SMS Spam Collection dataset and deepen our understanding of text datasets by jumping into a key preparatory step in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: detecting missing data and identifying data types. Real-world text datasets usually entail imperfections like missing values that could affect our analysis and outcomes if untreated. They can also be composed of different data types that need to be properly handled for precise and efficient processing. Our exemplary solution code provides you a practical approach to address these steps using Python and pandas.\n",
