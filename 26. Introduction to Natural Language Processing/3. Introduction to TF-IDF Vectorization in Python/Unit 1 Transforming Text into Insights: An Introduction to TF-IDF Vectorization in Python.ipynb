Using the SMS Spam Collection dataset, you will embark on a journey to first load this dataset, then without any constraints on document frequency, initialize a TfidfVectorizer. Your objective is to transform the 'message' column into TF-IDF vectors. Conclude your mission by showcasing the shape of your transformed universe. Good voyage!\n",
