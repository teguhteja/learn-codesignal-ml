In our previous lessons, we've explored using basic transcribing techniques with OpenAI's Whisper API, as well as calculating the media duration using FFmpeg. Today, we'll shift our focus to transcribing large files with OpenAI Whisper and FFmpeg. Managing large audio or video files by splitting them into manageable pieces ensures that tasks like transcription can be performed efficiently and without errors. This lesson will empower you to handle these files smoothly, leveraging FFmpeg's capabilities.\n",

To work around this constraint, we need a method to divide these large files into smaller, manageable chunks that can be processed sequentially. Our strategy involves leveraging FFmpeg's capabilities to split the files into segments that fall within the permissible size limit. This will ensure compatibility with OpenAI Whisper while maintaining the quality and integrity of the original content. By breaking down large files, we facilitate efficient transcription, allowing for smooth and accurate processing of each smaller segment.\n",

In this lesson, you've learned how to leverage FFmpeg's capabilities to efficiently break down large files into smaller, manageable chunks. By understanding the intricacies of file handling, you can now enhance file operations, reduce memory overhead, and enable parallel processing for improved performance, all while maintaining content quality. You’re now well-equipped to tackle large-scale multimedia tasks with confidence and precision!"
