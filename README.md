## How to Use

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the Jupyter notebooks
3. Explore the markdown explanations and code examples
4. Experiment with the code and adapt it to your projects

## Development Tools

This repository includes several automation tools to help with content creation and organization:

### `create_folder.py` - Folder Structure Generator

**Purpose**: Automatically creates folder structures based on course text files.

**How it works**:
- Reads a text file containing course outline
- Detects lines ending with "practices" as course section indicators
- Creates numbered folders for each section found after a "practices" line
- Useful for organizing course materials before converting to notebooks

**Usage**:
```bash
python create_folder.py <text_file>
```

**Example**:
```bash
python create_folder.py course-outline.txt
```

**Input format example**:
```
Unit 1
4 practices
16 min
Introduction to Tokenization (Rule-Based Tokenization)
Preview
Tokenize Text with NLTK
```

**Output**: Creates folder "1. Introduction to Tokenization (Rule-Based Tokenization)"

### `generate-ipynb.sh` - Jupyter Notebook Generator

**Purpose**: Converts structured text files into Jupyter notebooks with proper formatting.

**Features**:
- **Smart Filtering**: Automatically skips lines containing:
  - Number + "practices" (e.g., "4 practices")  
  - Number + "min" (e.g., "16 min")
  - "Preview" (case-insensitive)
- **Intelligent Naming**: Creates notebook filenames using Unit number + first valid content line
- **Content Structure**: Converts text content to markdown cells with proper heading hierarchy
- **Last Line Handling**: Ensures the last line of each unit becomes a heading in the notebook

**Usage**:
```bash
./generate-ipynb.sh <input_text_file>
```

**Example**:
```bash
./generate-ipynb.sh course-content.txt
```

**Input format example**:
```
Unit 1
4 practices
16 min
Introduction to Tokenization (Rule-Based Tokenization)
Preview
Tokenize Text with NLTK
Sentence Tokenization with NLTK
Extract Monetary Values with Regex

Unit 2
3 practices  
13 min
Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) – Subword Tokenization
Preview
Exploring Pre-trained Tokenizers with GPT-2
```

**Output**: 
- `1.Introduction-to-Tokenization-(Rule-Based-Tokenization).ipynb`
- `2.Byte-Pair-Encoding-(BPE)-–-Subword-Tokenization.ipynb`

**Generated Notebook Structure**:
- Unit title as H1 heading
- Content lines as H2 headings
- Last content line of each unit included as final heading
- Proper JSON structure for Jupyter notebooks

### Workflow Example

1. **Organize Structure**: Use `create_folder.py` to create folder hierarchy
2. **Generate Content**: Use `generate-ipynb.sh` to create notebook files
3. **Manual Enhancement**: Add code cells, explanations, and examples to the generated notebooks
