    "# Lesson 2: Crafting Effective Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Crafting Effective Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever asked a coworker for help, only to realize you’d left out half the details they needed? That same principle applies to talking with AI models: the clearer and more detailed your instructions, the more accurate and useful the responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Clear Prompts Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs (Large Language Models) rely on your input to generate relevant answers. Vague prompts often lead to irrelevant or off-topic responses. Compare these examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vague:** “Tell me about history.” → The AI might write about ancient Egypt, WWII, or the history of pizza.\n",
    "- **Specific:** “Explain the three main causes of World War II in bullet points.” → Directs the AI to focus on a specific event and format, helping it systematically organize the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Techniques for Effective Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "Try these strategies to improve your results:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Be Specific:** Include details like context, audience, and length.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Weak:** “Write a poem.”  \n",
    "  - **Strong:** “Write a 4-line rhyming poem about autumn, suitable for children.”\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Provide Examples:** Show the AI what you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Weak:** “Make a workout plan.”  \n",
    "  - **Strong:** “Create a 30-minute home workout plan without equipment, formatted like this example:  \n",
    "    Warm-up: 5 minutes of jumping jacks  \n",
    "    Core: 3 sets of planks…”\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Break Down Complex Tasks:** Use step-by-step language.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Weak:** “How do I start a business?”  \n",
    "  - **Strong:** “List 5 steps to register a small business in California, prioritizing cost-effectiveness.”\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n",
    "\n",
    "🚫 **Assuming Prior Knowledge**  \n",
    "- **Unclear:** “Fix this code.” (What’s wrong with it?)  \n",
    "- **Better:** “Debug this Python script that’s giving a ‘list index out of range’ error.”\n",
    "\n",
    "🚫 **Ignoring Format Preferences**  \n",
    "- **Unclear:** “Summarize this article.”  \n",
    "- **Better:** “Summarize this 2,000-word article into three short paragraphs with bold headings.”\n",
    "\n",
    "🚫 **Settling for First Drafts**  \n",
    "Refine prompts iteratively:  \n",
    "- **First output:** “Write a product description for wireless headphones.”  \n",
    "- **Improved:** “Rewrite this with more emotional appeal, focusing on gym enthusiasts.”\n",
    "\n",
    "By recognizing and avoiding these pitfalls, you’ll see real-world improvements in tasks like writing marketing copy, drafting reports, or brainstorming presentations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- Specificity = Better Results\n",
    "- Examples and structure guide the AI\n",
    "- Treat prompts as a conversation—refine as needed\n",
